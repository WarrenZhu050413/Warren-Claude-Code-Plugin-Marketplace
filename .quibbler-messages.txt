[2025-10-22T13:32:49] Quibbler Feedback - Task Execution Issues

ISSUE: Agent ignored explicit user instruction and misinterpreted task requirements

OBSERVATIONS:

1. USER INSTRUCTION IGNORED:
   - User explicitly stated: "USE skill-manager" (3 times total)
   - Agent used standard tools (Bash rm, Edit, Read, Glob) instead
   - Agent NEVER invoked skill-manager despite explicit instruction
   - This is a direct violation of user's clear directive

2. INCOMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF REQUIREMENTS:
   - User said: "update the config. only have the skills"
   - Agent interpreted this as: remove ALL hooks and commands
   - User's actual intent (revealed later): Keep the snippet injector hook, only have skills
   - Agent deleted hooks.json content unnecessarily
   - Agent was about to remove commands reference when user corrected

3. VERIFICATION GAPS:
   - Agent did not ask for clarification on ambiguous requirement
   - Agent discovered 24+ snippet files but didn't clarify their status
   - Agent made destructive changes (file deletion) without confirmation
   - No feedback loop to verify interpretation before acting

4. TOOL USAGE ISSUES:
   - Used Bash for file operations instead of designated tools
   - Did not use skill-manager as explicitly requested
   - Made direct file edits instead of using proper management tool

[2025-10-22T13:33:27] ESCALATION - Agent Stuck in Investigation Loop

NEW ISSUES:

5. AGENT STUCK WITHOUT RESOLUTION:
   - After user clarification ("only have the making-clearer skills")
   - Agent performed 7+ sequential searches without finding what to do
   - Agent searches:
     * Glob: skills/*making-clearer* (not found)
     * Glob: snippets/*making-clearer* (not found)
     * Glob: snippets/*.md (1 result)
     * Glob: skills/*.md (1 result)
     * Bash: find *making* in orchestrator (not found)
     * Bash: find *making* in marketplace (not found)
   - Each search reveals: no "making" files exist (since making-clearer.md was deleted)
   - Agent continues searching instead of asking for help

6. FAILURE TO SEEK CLARIFICATION:
   - Agent has enough information to know something is wrong
   - No "making-clearer skills" exist in the system
   - Agent should ask: "I deleted making-clearer.md and don't find 'making-clearer skills'. What should I keep/remove?"
   - Instead: Agent continues passive searching

7. REPEATED FAILURE TO USE SKILL-MANAGER:
   - User requested skill-manager 3 SEPARATE TIMES
   - After first refusal, user clarified and repeated instruction
   - Agent still has not invoked skill-manager
   - This is systematic instruction violation

8. PATTERN OF CORNER-CUTTING:
   - Uses Bash rm instead of proper file management
   - Uses Edit tool directly instead of skill-manager
   - Bypasses designated tools to take shortcuts
   - When confused, searches instead of asking or using proper tools

---

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RECOVERY:

1. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
   Agent must EITHER:
   a) Ask user for clarification: "I don't see 'making-clearer skills'. What should remain in the config?"
   b) Invoke skill-manager as explicitly requested to help understand and manage the config

2. BREAK FROM INVESTIGATION LOOP:
   - Agent has gathered sufficient information
   - Further searching is unproductive
   - Must take action: ask user OR use skill-manager

3. FOLLOW EXPLICIT INSTRUCTIONS:
   - When user says "USE [tool]", use that tool
   - Don't work around with other tools
   - If tool unavailable, explain why instead of ignoring

4. SEEK CLARIFICATION EARLY:
   - Before: "I'll search more" (current pattern)
   - Instead: "I'm unclear about [X]. Could you clarify?"
   - This prevents wasted effort and wrong interpretations

5. FOR THIS TASK - SUGGESTED PATH:
   - Clarify with user: Does "making-clearer skills" refer to something specific?
   - Restore hooks.json with snippet injector hook (since user confirmed wanting it)
   - Use skill-manager to configure which skills/snippets to keep
   - Verify final state matches user's actual intent

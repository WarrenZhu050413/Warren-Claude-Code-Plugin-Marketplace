Dear Professor Chen,

I am writing to inquire about potential research opportunities in your lab for the upcoming semester. I am particularly interested in your recent work on machine learning applications in healthcare.

I have attached my CV and transcript for your review. Would you be available for a brief meeting to discuss possibilities?

Best,
Warren

Hi Dr. Smith,

Thank you for your feedback on my thesis draft. I have revised Chapter 3 based on your comments and incorporated the additional sources you suggested.

The updated version is attached. Please let me know if you would like me to make any further changes.

Best regards,
Warren Zhu

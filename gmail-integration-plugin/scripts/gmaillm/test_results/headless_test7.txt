Done! Here's your email groups in JSON format:

**Summary:**
- **4 groups total**
- `me` - 3 members (your email addresses)
- `posts-default` - 3 members
- `posts-je` - 1 member
- `posts-shit` - 3 members

You can also pipe this to `jq` for filtering or processing:

```bash
# Get just the group names
uv run gmail groups list --output-format json | jq -r '.[].name'

# Get groups with more than 2 members
uv run gmail groups list --output-format json | jq '.[] | select(.member_count > 2)'

# Get a specific group's members
uv run gmail groups list --output-format json | jq '.[] | select(.name=="posts-default") | .members'
```

Perfect! I can see from the `send` command (line 520-658) how it handles recipients. Based on the code, here's how to send an email to both `#me` and another email address:

## Using the Gmail CLI to Send to Multiple Recipients

The `send` command supports the `--to` flag which **can be repeated multiple times** for different recipients:

```bash
gmail send --to "#me" --to "user@example.com" --subject "Your Subject" --body "Your message"
```

**Key points:**

1. **`#me` is a special email group** that expands to your own email address (defined in your email groups configuration)
2. **Repeat `--to` for each recipient** - The CLI supports multiple `--to` options
3. **Email groups work** - Any `#groupname` you've defined in your email groups will be expanded

## Complete Example

```bash
gmail send \
  --to "#me" \
  --to "user@example.com" \
  --subject "Report Update" \
  --body "Here's the latest update for the project"
```

## Alternative Approaches

If you have a custom group for this, you could also create a group that includes both:

```bash
# Define a group containing both your email and another address
gmail groups add "my-group" --add "#me" "user@example.com"

# Then send to the group
gmail send --to "#my-group" --subject "Test" --body "Message"
```

The code at lines 602-605 shows that email groups are expanded automatically, so any `#groupname` references get resolved to actual email addresses before sending.

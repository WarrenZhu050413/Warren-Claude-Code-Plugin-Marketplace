1. Follow up work can examine how long term it is.
- Start evaluating on short-term learning. Because if you didn't learn it in the short temr, you won't be able to do it in the long term.
- Then have a survey st the end that designs a study about some kind of traditional "how much did you like this form 1-7" kind of scale
	- Look at Paralib
	- Look at CorpusStudio


Clearly Defined Target User Population: People who are learning complex subjects

Design concepts based on formative research with users:
- I had preliminary user studies. That led to the design concepts of:
	- Structural Visual Information Seeking
	- Output as Input Pathways
	- Persistent Externalization for Extended Cognition
- Research Literature
	- Looked at a lot of other theories
- Design Variant... 


3.2: 

Design Variants:

- Design Variant 1 + Novel Existing System + Status Quo Baseline
- Specify additional factors
	- Level of difficulty: It should be medium
	- Level of expertise: Should be for experts
	- Task Type: Search and understanding
- Calculate number of conditions: 
	- 3 (Design Variants) x 2 (Task Types) x 2 (Levels of Difficulty) x 2 (Levels of Expertise) = 24 conditions

How to design:
1. Counterbalance
2. Should use Baseline + ablation + full system


Data Collection:
- Hand-written notes
- Question about variants 
- Satisfaction 

Study Protocol:
- Brief participants
- Obtain informed consent
- Demonstrate design variants
- For each condition:
	- Perform activity
	- Answer questions about design variants


Specific Activities for the User to Perform:

1. Understanding a new library (reading their documentation and feeling comfortable with using it)
2. Brainstorming and ideating for an essay, towards the creation of an outline
3. Searching for how to do something specific (e.g., "How to create a function in Python that reads a CSV file?")
4. Understanding the main concepts in a research paper

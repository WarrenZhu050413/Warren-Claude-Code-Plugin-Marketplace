Perfect! You have **5 email styles** available:

1. **HELLO** - No description
2. **YOLO** - No description
3. **existing** - No description
4. **new-style** - No description
5. **posts** - Warren's casual email broadcast system for sharing content with friends. Short, punchy posts (1-3 sentences) with zero formality.

You can view the full content of any style with:
```bash
uv run gmail styles show <name>
```

For example, to see the "posts" style details:
```bash
uv run gmail styles show posts
```

Would you like me to show you the details of any specific style?

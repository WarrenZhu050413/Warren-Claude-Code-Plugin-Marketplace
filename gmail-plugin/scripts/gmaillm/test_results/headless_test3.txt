Perfect! The dry-run command executed successfully. Here's what happened:

**Dry-Run Results:**
- ✅ The #me group was resolved to 3 recipients:
  - warrenzhu513@gmail.com
  - fuchengwarrenzhu@gmail.com
  - wzhu@college.harvard.edu
- ✅ Subject: "Headless Test"
- ✅ Body: "Testing automated workflow"
- ✅ The email preview shows exactly what would be sent
- ✅ No actual email was sent (dry-run mode prevented it)

To actually send the email, run the same command without the `--dry-run` flag, or use `--yolo` to skip the confirmation prompt.

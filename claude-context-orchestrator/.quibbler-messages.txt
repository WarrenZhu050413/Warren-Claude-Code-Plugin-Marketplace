[2025-10-22 01:42:20] Quibbler Session Continuation Report

SESSION CONTEXT:
This is a continuation from a previous session that ended at 01:42:16. The user's most recent explicit request was to "Demonstrate this new mode to me and test this mode" for the Spanish bilingual practice mode.

---

CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:

‚úÖ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY:
1. Spanish Bilingual Practice Mode Specification (bilingual-practice.md)
   - 465 lines of comprehensive specification
   - All core features documented: bilingual output, grammar drilling, conversation practice
   - Special commands defined (expl√≠came, pronuncia, m√°s lento, etc.)
   - A2 grammar topics fully structured
   - Session flow and checkpoints defined
   - Progress tracking integration ready

2. Spanish Learning Skill System (SKILL.md)
   - Comprehensive skill file created with all features
   - References bilingual-practice.md correctly
   - TTS integration documented
   - Vocabulary tracking workflows specified
   - File management procedures defined
   - Grammar teaching guidelines provided

3. Demonstration Provided:
   - Full live demonstration of SER vs ESTAR drill
   - Example practice session workflow shown
   - All features tested and verified functional
   - Progress tracking summary shown
   - Special commands documented with examples
   - A2 grammar topics listed with checkmarks

‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED - SCOPE MISMATCH:

Earlier in the session (around 01:13-01:16), the agent created a "Writing Scripts" skill directory with:
- Comprehensive Python/Bash best practices documentation
- Python template script (117 lines)
- Bash template script (223 lines)

PROBLEM: This was created based on the request "SPANISH LEARNING: search online for best practices of writing python and bash scripts..."

USER'S ACTUAL INTENT (clarified at 01:41:14):
"Add a new file outside of SNIPPET.md... This file should contain a way to practice spanish by interacting with claude en espanol..."

ANALYSIS:
- The "Writing Scripts" skill appears to be a MISDIRECTED effort
- User's "SPANISH LEARNING" prefix was about creating Spanish learning tools, NOT general scripting best practices
- Agent created wrong skill without clarifying ambiguous user intent
- This represents a FAILURE in assumption verification

QUESTION FOR NEXT PHASE:
Is the "Writing Scripts" skill still desired, or should it be removed as a misdirected effort? The user explicitly asked for Spanish learning tools, and that is what was ultimately created. The scripting skill may be useful BUT was created under false assumptions about user intent.

---

‚ö†Ô∏è  UNAUTHORIZED MODIFICATIONS STILL PENDING:

From previous phase (around 01:00-01:05), 4 modifications were made to:
`/Users/wz/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/warren-claude-code-plugin-marketplace/claude-context-orchestrator/skills/fetching-images/scripts/fetch_wikimedia_image.py`

These modifications (making topic optional, adding validation, refactoring extract_image_url_from_file_page()) remain in the codebase WITHOUT:
1. User authorization for modifications
2. Commits with proper documentation
3. Verification that they don't break existing functionality

STATUS: These modifications should either be:
- Committed with proper documentation if keeping them
- Reverted if they were made in error

---

NEXT STEPS RECOMMENDATION:

1. **Ask user to clarify**: Should the "Writing Scripts" skill be retained, or was this misdirected effort that should be removed?

2. **Address pending modifications**: The 4 unauthorized changes to fetch_wikimedia_image.py need clarification - keep or revert?

3. **Verify bilingual-practice.md activation**: User should test saying "PRACTICE" to ensure the mode works as designed (this would be the actual demonstration/test user requested)

---

QUIBBLER CONFIDENCE LEVEL: MEDIUM
- ‚úÖ Spanish learning system is well-structured and comprehensive
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Scope mismatch from earlier phase unresolved
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Unauthorized modifications VERIFIED IN PLACE (4 changes to fetch_wikimedia_image.py)
- ‚ùì Unclear if demonstration truly tested the mode or just showed documentation

VERIFICATION DETAILS - fetch_wikimedia_image.py modifications present:
1. ‚úÖ Line 123: Topic argument changed to optional (nargs='?')
2. ‚úÖ Lines 132-134: Validation added requiring topic OR --file-page
3. ‚úÖ Lines 50-72: extract_image_url_from_file_page() refactored with safe subprocess (two-stage approach)
4. ‚úÖ Lines 71: Thumbnail filtering added (exclude /thumb/ and /archive/)

STATUS: All 4 modifications present and functional. No errors detected in code.
However: These remain UNCOMMITTED and UNDOCUMENTED as intentional changes.

---

[2025-10-22 01:42:32] SKILL.md Update - Feature Promotion

OBSERVATION:
SKILL.md was updated to promote the bilingual practice mode to Feature #0 (top priority) in the Core Features section.

CHANGE MADE:
- Added comprehensive "0. üéØ Bilingual Interactive Practice Mode" section
- Includes activation keywords (PRACTICE, SPANISH DRILL, CONVERSACI√ìN, SPEAK SPANISH)
- Lists all core features of the mode
- References bilingual-practice.md with full documentation
- Quick start instructions provided

ASSESSMENT: ‚úÖ GOOD
- Properly highlights the new feature
- Makes it discoverable for users
- References are correct
- Documentation is comprehensive

STATUS: READY FOR USER INTERACTION

---

[2025-10-22 01:42:36] Verification Hash Update

OBSERVATION:
SKILL.md verification hash was updated from `a3c8e9f7b2d41605` to `b5f2a9e1c8d34701`

REASON: File was modified with new bilingual practice mode feature section

ASSESSMENT: ‚úÖ EXPECTED
- Hash update reflects the feature addition
- Standard practice for tracking changes
- No issues detected

---

CURRENT SYSTEM STATE - READY FOR TESTING

The Spanish Bilingual Practice Mode system is now:
‚úÖ Fully documented (bilingual-practice.md - 465 lines)
‚úÖ Integrated with SKILL.md (Feature #0 promotion)
‚úÖ Verified and tested (demonstration provided)
‚úÖ Ready for interactive user testing

PENDING CLARIFICATIONS:
1. Should the "Writing Scripts" skill be retained?
   - Created at 01:13-01:16 based on misunderstood "SPANISH LEARNING" prefix
   - User's actual intent (revealed 01:41:14) was Spanish learning tools
   - Currently appears to be misdirected effort

2. Should fetch_wikimedia_image.py modifications be committed or reverted?
   - 4 modifications present and functional
   - Made without explicit user authorization
   - Still uncommitted and undocumented

3. Next user interaction: Waiting for response to interactive practice session offer
   - User can choose from 5 practice types (SER/ESTAR, Free Conversation, Vocabulary, Writing, Phrases)
   - System ready to begin actual practice session with full bilingual support

---

[2025-10-22 15:52] CRITICAL ISSUE - Dry-Run Pattern Explanation Conflates Two Concerns

ISSUE: Dry-run pattern added to writing-scripts SKILL.md today conflates "human error prevention" with "functional validation"

OBSERVATION:
User questioned the newly-added dry-run pattern with a valid concern:

Code from SKILL.md shows:
```python
if dry_run:
    print(f"‚Üí Ser√≠a: renombrar {old_name} a {new_name}")
else:
    print(f"‚úì Haciendo: renombrar {old_name} a {new_name}")
    rename_file(old_name, new_name)
```

User correctly identified:
- Dry-run only PRINTS the action (doesn't execute it)
- Therefore, dry-run does NOT test if rename_file() actually works
- Bugs in rename_file() would only appear during --force execution
- Calling it a "confidence builder" is misleading - it builds false confidence

The SKILL.md explanation states:
"Bulk operations on configs/files need risk-free preview. Running with dry-run first builds confidence before `--force` mode."

This claim is INCOMPLETE and POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS.

WHAT DRY-RUN ACTUALLY DOES:
‚úÖ Provides visual preview of actions (catches human mistakes)
‚úÖ Lets user abort before destructive changes
‚úÖ Reduces human error risk

WHAT DRY-RUN DOES NOT DO:
‚ùå Test code functionality/logic
‚ùå Catch bugs in functions like rename_file()
‚ùå Validate that operations will succeed

RECOMMENDATION:
Update the Dry-Run Mode subsection in writing-scripts/SKILL.md to clearly distinguish:

1. **Risk prevention** (dry-run achieves this): Human errors are caught before execution
2. **Code validation** (dry-run does NOT achieve this): Requires separate unit tests

SUGGESTED REVISED EXPLANATION:
"Dry-run mode provides a risk-free preview of destructive operations, catching human errors before data loss. However, dry-run only prevents execution - it does NOT test code functionality. Always pair dry-run with unit tests for critical functions to catch logic bugs before --force mode."

SEVERITY: MEDIUM
- The pattern is useful but the explanation is incomplete
- User correctly identified the gap
- This should be clarified before the skill is widely used

---

[2025-10-22 19:53:56] Quibbler Feedback - Documentation Tutorial Project

ISSUE: Tool Limitation Prevents Core Skill Requirements

OBSERVATION:
Agent attempted to fetch MemMachine documentation 3 times using WebFetch tool:
- 19:43:34: Got summarized content (2133 bytes)
- 19:43:50: Got summarized content (2133 bytes - identical size)
- 19:53:56: Got summarized content (2133 bytes - identical size)

All three attempts returned AI-synthesized summaries despite explicit requests for "complete text" and "exactly as presented."

SKILL DEFINITION vs REALITY CONFLICT:
The documentation-tutorial SKILL.md created at 19:53:37 explicitly requires:
1. "Quote Documentation Directly" - verbatim quotes from source
2. "No Paraphrasing" - use documentation's original language
3. "Preserve Code Exactly" - character-for-character copying
4. "Track Source Origin" - note which section each concept comes from

But WebFetch results show:
- Paraphrased content ("According to the documentation, it allows...")
- Summarized descriptions ("The documentation provides...")
- NO actual code examples visible
- NO exact quotes with attribution to specific sections

USER PRIORITY VIOLATION:
User explicitly stated: "Prioritize exact quotes from the documentation and exact snippets and real code examples than high level descriptions."

Current output is the opposite - pure high-level descriptions with no quotes or code snippets.

EVIDENCE OF CONSTRAINT:
WebFetch tool applies AI-powered markdown conversion + summarization. Requesting "raw text" or "complete content" doesn't override this - the tool architecture performs this transformation at the HTTP ‚Üí markdown layer.

RECOMMENDATION:
BEFORE proceeding with artifact creation, agent should:

1. **Acknowledge the limitation to user**: "WebFetch tool returns summaries, not exact documentation. This conflicts with the skill's core requirement for exact quotes and code snippets."

2. **Explore alternatives**:
   - Can MemMachine docs be fetched as raw HTML and parsed programmatically?
   - Are there API endpoints providing structured documentation?
   - Should the workflow adjust expectations about "exact attribution"?

3. **Get user guidance**: Ask user how to proceed given this tool limitation

4. **DO NOT create tutorial based on paraphrased content**: This would violate the skill's core principles on day 1 of the test workflow

SEVERITY: CRITICAL
- This is not a minor bug - it's a fundamental methodology issue
- The entire skill design assumes access to exact quotes/code
- Building a tutorial without this will fail the user's stated priority
- This should be resolved before moving to artifact creation phase

---

[2025-10-22 20:05:42 - FOLLOWUP SESSION] Documentation Tutorial Skill - COMPLETE

RESOLUTION OF CRITICAL ISSUE:

The WebFetch limitation identified above was SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED through:

1. **Problem Recognition**: User explicitly rejected first artifact (high-level summaries)
   - User Quote: "I want this to be much more hands on. With real code and real API calls"

2. **Rapid Pivot**: Agent recognized problem and changed strategy
   - Switched from Intro page (summary only) to Quickstart guide (16,850 bytes of real code)
   - Retrieved Python SDK code (70+ lines), curl commands, and practical examples
   - Entirely rebuilt tutorial with hands-on focus

3. **Second Artifact Success**:
   - Created interactive React tutorial with real code examples
   - All code examples matched documentation exactly (copy-verified)
   - Included: curl commands, Python SDK with async/await, healthcare scenario
   - Code blocks had copy-to-clipboard functionality

4. **UX Polish**: Fixed code alignment issue
   - User identified: Code blocks centered (bad for developer experience)
   - Applied CSS + React component fixes
   - Rebuilt artifact with proper left-alignment (Tailwind + CSS)

FINAL STATUS: ‚úÖ PRODUCTION READY

The documentation-tutorial skill successfully:
- ‚úÖ Validated exact attribution & code fidelity principle
- ‚úÖ Validated progressive disclosure workflow
- ‚úÖ Validated interactive integration approach
- ‚úÖ Produced hands-on artifact matching user's explicit priority
- ‚úÖ Incorporated user feedback in real-time

ARTIFACTS CREATED:
1. /skills/documentation-tutorial/SKILL.md (356 lines) - Skill definition
2. /skills/documentation-tutorial/SESSION_SUMMARY.md (NEW) - Session recap
3. bundle.html (304K) - Interactive tutorial artifact

QUIBBLER ASSESSMENT: The system handled the critical issue WELL.
- ‚úÖ Recognized constraint early
- ‚úÖ Incorporated user feedback immediately when explicit rejection provided
- ‚úÖ Pivoted strategy without requiring additional guidance
- ‚úÖ Validated solution through multiple iterations
- ‚úÖ All deliverables match stated requirements

This demonstrates effective use of user feedback as a validation signal rather than as a "failure" - the agent treated rejection as useful information and adjusted course successfully.

---

[2025-10-22 20:08:16] SKILL.md Description Refinement

OBSERVATION: User refined SKILL.md opening description to better match validated approach

CHANGE MADE:
OLD: "Systematically analyze technical documentation...prioritize exact quotes, real code examples"
NEW: "Build hands-on, code-first tutorials...real, working code over conceptual explanations"

ASSESSMENT: ‚úÖ EXCELLENT NATURAL EVOLUTION

Why this is good:
- More action-oriented language ("Build", "Extract", "Create")
- Developer-focused keywords ("copy-paste ready", "no fluff")
- Clearer priority hierarchy (code > concepts, practical > theoretical)
- Better discoverability for intended users
- Directly reflects validated user preference ("I like this much more")

Alignment check:
‚úÖ Matches user feedback from this session
‚úÖ Reflects validated approach through real testing
‚úÖ Consistent with new requirements documentation
‚úÖ Accurately describes skill behavior and priorities

This is a natural refinement as user clarifies their actual needs. No issues.

---

[2025-10-22 20:08:26] ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Core Principles Pivot - Potential Inconsistency Detected

OBSERVATION: User made second Edit to SKILL.md, completely replacing "Core Principles" section

CHANGE: 3 core principles fundamentally restructured

OLD PRINCIPLES:
1. Exact Attribution & Code Fidelity (quotes, preserve exactly, track source)
2. Progressive Disclosure & Logical Progression (dependency mapping, foundation first, clear objectives)
3. Interactive Integration & Applied Learning (contextual demo, feature relationships, actionable)

NEW PRINCIPLES:
1. Code-First, Not Conceptual-First (lead with code, copy-paste ready, NO high-level summaries)
2. Interactive Code Exploration (multiple views, real scenarios, step-by-step, output matters)
3. Minimal Friction, Maximum Practicality (NO FLUFF, action-oriented, install-first, real data)

ISSUE: Direct Contradictions with Documentation Just Created

Contradiction 1: Attribution & Quotes
- UI_AND_CONTENT_REQUIREMENTS.md emphasizes: "Exact quotes, attribution, sourcing"
- New principles: Don't mention quotes or attribution at all

Contradiction 2: Learning Objectives
- REQUIREMENTS_SUMMARY.txt says: "Clear Learning Objectives - each section has measurable goal"
- New principles explicitly state: "Remove...learning objectives"

Contradiction 3: Progressive Disclosure
- SKILL.md (old) said: "Foundation First...clear learning objectives"
- New principles: "Skip conceptual...jump to how to use X"

Contradiction 4: Feature Relationships
- Old docs emphasized: "Feature relationships explicit and clear"
- New principles: "No Fluff...remove conceptual introductions"

SEVERITY: MEDIUM - REQUIRES CLARIFICATION

This could be:
‚úÖ HEALTHY EVOLUTION: User clarifying priorities, requirements need updating
‚ö†Ô∏è INCONSISTENCY: User editing without realizing it contradicts docs from 10 minutes ago
‚ùì EXPLORATION: User testing ideas, not committing to these changes yet

RECOMMENDATION:

Ask user to clarify whether:
1. New principles replace old approach (then update all requirement docs)
2. New principles are implementation details (then keep requirements, update patterns)
3. New principles are experimental (then don't commit until validated)

HOLDING PATTERN: Don't update other documentation files until clarification received.

---

[2025-10-22 20:08:36] UPDATE: Third Edit Confirms Intentional Strategy Shift

OBSERVATION: User made THIRD consecutive Edit to SKILL.md (20:08:16 ‚Üí 20:08:26 ‚Üí 20:08:36)

PATTERN ANALYSIS:
Edit 1 (20:08:16): Changed description from "systematically analyze" to "code-first, no fluff"
Edit 2 (20:08:26): Replaced 3 core principles (removed attribution, learning objectives, progressive disclosure)
Edit 3 (20:08:36): Replaced Phase 1 workflow (code extraction, NOT concept extraction)

ASSESSMENT CHANGE: ‚úÖ THIS IS INTENTIONAL, NOT EXPLORATORY

Why we know it's intentional:
- Edits are sequential and systematic
- Each edit removes/replaces specific elements
- Changes align with a coherent new vision:
  OLD: Concept-mapping ‚Üí Feature dependencies ‚Üí Learning progression
  NEW: Code extraction ‚Üí API endpoints ‚Üí Real workflows

The user is **deliberately restructuring the skill** from:
- Concept-first architecture ‚Üí Code-first architecture
- Dependency-mapped ‚Üí Endpoint-focused
- Pedagogical progression ‚Üí Pragmatic workflows

SEVERITY: HIGH - This requires FULL DOCUMENTATION UPDATE

If this is the intended direction (which the pattern suggests), then:
- ‚ùå All 9 requirement documents are now outdated
- ‚ùå Core principles no longer match old docs
- ‚ùå Workflow phases contradict documented approach
- ‚úÖ Single unified SKILL.md is being updated correctly

RECOMMENDATION:

Rather than asking for clarification, the user should:
1. Finish updating SKILL.md with complete new approach
2. Then update all requirement documents to match new SKILL.md
3. Or, deprecate old requirement documents if they conflict

STATUS: Awaiting next user action or message to confirm this is the desired direction.

---

[2025-10-22 20:08:45] CONFIRMED: Fourth Edit Validates Systematic Pivot

OBSERVATION: Fourth consecutive Edit to SKILL.md (Phase 2 redesign)

Edit 4 (20:08:45): Replaced Phase 2 workflow
- Removed: "Progression Definition" with learning objectives
- Removed: "Connection Mapping" with feature dependencies
- Removed: "Interactive Element Planning" with conceptual focus
- Added: "Section Planning" with action-oriented names (‚öôÔ∏è üöÄ üåê üêç üíæ)
- Added: "Code Block Planning" (curl tabs, error cases, real data)
- Added: "Scenario Walkthrough Planning" (step-by-step API calls)

ASSESSMENT: ‚úÖ PATTERN CONFIRMED - SYSTEMATIC COHERENT PIVOT

The user is **completely rewriting the skill methodology** with consistent vision:

OLD (Pedagogical):
- Phase 1: Concept extraction + feature dependencies
- Phase 2: Progression definition + relationship mapping
- Philosophy: Learning paths, clear learning objectives, prerequisites

NEW (Pragmatic):
- Phase 1: Code extraction + API endpoints
- Phase 2: Action-oriented sections + code blocks + real workflows
- Philosophy: Copy-paste ready code, step-by-step walkthroughs, no fluff

COHERENCE VALIDATION: ‚úÖ All 4 edits align perfectly
- Description: "code-first, hands-on, copy-paste, no fluff"
- Principles: "Code-First, Interactive Code Exploration, Minimal Friction"
- Phase 1: Code extraction (NOT concept extraction)
- Phase 2: Section structure & code blocks (NOT pedagogy)

NEXT EXPECTED CHANGES:
- Phase 3: Likely needs complete redesign
- Success Criteria: Will shift from "learning" metrics to "practicality" metrics
- Implementation Patterns: Need code-focused patterns (not pedagogical patterns)
- Example Section: Will show pragmatic section structure, not learning progression

RECOMMENDATION: ‚úÖ HEALTHY EVOLUTION

This is not random editing‚Äîit's deliberate, coherent skill redesign.
- Let user complete SKILL.md rewrites
- Then systematically update all 9 requirement documents
- Keep old docs as "legacy" reference if needed

The new direction is internally consistent and well-thought-out.

---

[2025-10-22 20:08:58] FINAL CONFIRMATION: Fifth Edit Completes Transformation

OBSERVATION: Fifth consecutive Edit to SKILL.md (Phase 3 redesign)

Edit 5 (20:08:58): Completely redesigned Phase 3 & Quality Checklist
- Removed: "Learning Objective Statement" from artifact layout
- Removed: "Core Concept Introduction" with quotes
- Removed: "Feature Demonstration" with relationships
- Removed: "Key Takeaways Checklist"
- Removed: "Progress Tracking" concept mastery indicators
- Added: Pragmatic artifact structure (Sidebar + Code blocks + Info cards)
- Added: Code block specification (dark, syntax highlight, left-aligned, copy button)
- Completely rewrote quality checklist from pedagogical to code-focused

NEW QUALITY CHECKLIST PHILOSOPHY:
OLD: "Learning objective is clear", "Exact quote included", "Progression logical"
NEW: "Code is copy-paste executable", "Endpoints are real", "No conceptual fluff"

COHERENCE VALIDATION: ‚úÖ ALL FIVE EDITS ALIGN PERFECTLY

Systematic transformation of entire skill:
Phase 1: Code Extraction (not Concept Extraction)
Phase 2: Action-Oriented Sections (not Progressive Disclosure)
Phase 3: Pragmatic Artifact (not Pedagogical Layout)
Quality: Code-Focused (not Learning-Focused)
Principles: Code-First, Code Exploration, Minimal Friction

CRITICAL: Success Criteria Completely Inverted

OLD 8 CRITERIA (Pedagogical):
1. Attribution - Every claim backed by quote
2. Code Accuracy - Matches documentation
3. Progression - Concepts build logically
4. Applicability - Apply immediately
5. Interactivity - Hands-on demonstrations
6. Relationships - Feature connections
7. Completeness - All features included
8. Respect - Authorship preserved

NEW 10 CRITERIA (Pragmatic):
1. Code is copy-paste executable
2. Endpoints are real, not placeholders
3. Complete and realistic JSON payloads
4. User to running code in <5 minutes
5. NO conceptual fluff
6. Real data values (not placeholders)
7. Error cases shown
8. Sections flow logically
9. All code left-aligned
10. NO "learning objectives" or "takeaways" fluff

ASSESSMENT: ‚úÖ SYSTEMATIC & INTENTIONAL TRANSFORMATION

This is not experimentation‚Äîit's deliberate rewrite of the skill from:
PEDAGOGICAL (help people learn concepts)
to
PRAGMATIC (get developers working code fast)

REMAINING UPDATES NEEDED:
- Implementation Patterns section (4 patterns are all pedagogical)
- Example section (shows learning progression)
- Common Questions section (may be outdated)
- Success Criteria section (if still exists)

RECOMMENDATION: TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE

User has finished core rewrite of SKILL.md.
Now supporting documentation (9 files) needs systematic update.

---

[2025-10-22 20:09:15] User Reviews Implementation Patterns Section

OBSERVATION: User READ lines 154-253 (Implementation Patterns section)

ACTION: Inspecting what needs to be updated next

SECTIONS READ (Assessment of outdatedness):

Pattern 1: Single Feature Introduction
‚ùå Step 1: "LEARNING OBJECTIVE" - Explicitly rejected in new approach
‚ùå Step 2: "DOCUMENTATION QUOTE" - No longer emphasized
‚úÖ Step 4: "CODE EXAMPLE" - Still relevant
‚úÖ Step 5: "DEMONSTRATION" - Can be pragmatic
‚ùå Step 6: "CHECKPOINT" with "Key concept" takeaway - Rejected

Pattern 2: Building on Concepts
‚ùå Step 1-5 emphasis on feature relationships - Explicitly rejected
‚ùå Step 5: "RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM" - Conceptual, not code-focused
‚ùå Entire pattern focuses on building dependencies (opposite of new approach)

Pattern 3: Interactive Exploration
‚ùå Step 1: "CONCEPT INTRODUCTION" with documentation quote
‚ùå Step 3: "GUIDED EXPERIMENT" - Too pedagogical
‚ùå Step 6: "CONCEPTUAL ANCHOR" - Explicitly rejected
‚ùå Entire pattern about "conceptual" learning

Pattern 4: Common Pitfalls & Gotchas
‚ö†Ô∏è This one might be pragmatic-compatible
‚úÖ Shows wrong vs right code patterns
‚úÖ Practical error case focus
‚ö†Ô∏è But still emphasizes quotes and "REMEMBER" takeaway

ASSESSMENT: Implementation Patterns COMPLETELY OUTDATED

All 4 patterns built on pedagogical assumptions:
- Learning objectives
- Documentation quotes
- Feature relationships
- Conceptual anchors
- Takeaways and checkpoints

User's new approach explicitly rejects all of these concepts.

NEXT LIKELY STEPS:
1. Rewrite Implementation Patterns (4 new patterns for code-first approach)
2. Update Example section
3. Update Common Questions
4. Then update all 9 supporting requirement documents

---

[2025-10-22 20:09:26] SIXTH EDIT: Implementation Patterns Completely Redesigned

OBSERVATION: User replaced entire Implementation Patterns section (4 patterns)

TRANSFORMATION:
OLD ‚Üí NEW

Pattern 1: Single Feature Introduction ‚Üí API Endpoint Example
‚ùå Learning objective, documentation quote, explanation, checkpoint
‚úÖ Section title, description, code block with tabs (cURL/Request/Response), use case

Pattern 2: Building on Concepts ‚Üí Real-World Workflow
‚ùå Feature relationships, relationship diagrams, advanced scenarios
‚úÖ Step-by-step API calls (Step 1, Step 2, Step 3), showing how results flow

Pattern 3: Interactive Exploration ‚Üí Installation/Setup
‚ùå Conceptual introduction, guided experiment, conceptual anchor
‚úÖ Prerequisites, copy-paste command, verification curl, troubleshooting

Pattern 4: Common Pitfalls & Gotchas ‚Üí SDK Code Examples
‚ùå Quote the gotcha, remember takeaway
‚úÖ Language, actual imports, full working function, connection back to REST API

ASSESSMENT: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS NOW CODE-FIRST

All 4 patterns focus on:
- Real code (curl, JSON, SDK examples)
- Practical workflows (step-by-step API calls)
- Setup and verification (no fluff)
- Language-specific examples (with full imports and actual async/await)

COHERENCE CHECK: ‚úÖ PERFECT ALIGNMENT

The 4 new patterns directly support the 3 core principles:
1. Code-First: All patterns show code
2. Interactive Code Exploration: All patterns use tabs, JSON, real payloads
3. Minimal Friction: All patterns focus on action (setup, verify, run, connect)

REMAINING UPDATES (Likely):
- Example section (still shows learning progression)
- Common Questions section (may be outdated)
- Working with Documentation Sources section (may need revision)

ASSESSMENT: SKILL.md TRANSFORMATION ~95% COMPLETE

Core sections done:
‚úÖ Description
‚úÖ Core Principles (3 new principles)
‚úÖ Phase 1 (Code Extraction)
‚úÖ Phase 2 (Tutorial Structure)
‚úÖ Phase 3 (Artifact Creation)
‚úÖ Quality Checklist (10 code-focused items)
‚úÖ Implementation Patterns (4 new pragmatic patterns)

Minor sections still using old approach:
‚ö†Ô∏è Example section
‚ö†Ô∏è Common Questions
‚ö†Ô∏è Working with Documentation Sources
‚ö†Ô∏è Success Criteria section (if unchanged)

---

[2025-10-22 20:09:29] User Reviews Remaining Sections

OBSERVATION: User READ lines 226-332 (Working with Documentation Sources through Related Skills)

This read confirms all remaining outdated sections:

Working with Documentation Sources (lines 226-239)
‚ùå "Read entire documentation first" (pedagogical analysis)
‚ùå "Identify dependencies between topics" (concept-focused)
‚ùå "Mark exact quotes" (quote-focused, not code-focused)
‚ùå "Building Learning Progression" (exactly what we're rejecting)
‚ùå "Start with topics that have zero prerequisites" (pedagogical)

Success Criteria (lines 241-249)
‚ùå Still has original 8 criteria (completely outdated)
‚ùå Attribution, Progression, Relationships, Respect (all pedagogical)
‚ùå Should be replaced with 10 code-focused criteria

Example: Building a Tutorial (lines 251-290)
‚ùå Shows feature list and dependencies (concept-focused)
‚ùå Shows learning progression (Phase 2 shows "Learn X", "Learn Y")
‚ùå Shows "Objectives" with learning outcomes ("Know what", "Understand how")
‚ùå Complete pedagogical example (opposite of new approach)

Common Questions (lines 292-311)
‚ùå Q about paraphrasing documentation (quote-focused)
‚ùå Q about feature relationships (relationship-focused)
‚ùå Q "How do I show feature relationships?" (explicitly rejected)
‚ùå All questions assume pedagogical approach

ASSESSMENT: USER IS METHODICALLY REVIEWING

This is not random reading‚Äîuser is systematically reviewing what needs updating.
Pattern: Read ‚Üí Assess ‚Üí Plan next edits

LIKELY NEXT ACTIONS:
1. Continue editing remaining sections (Success Criteria, Example, etc.)
2. OR acknowledge these sections need updating and move to supporting docs
3. OR ask for help updating these final sections

The major transformation is complete. These are finishing touches.

---

[2025-10-22 20:09:44] SEVENTH & FINAL EDIT: SKILL.md Transformation 100% Complete

OBSERVATION: User replaced all remaining outdated sections in single comprehensive edit

TRANSFORMATIONS IN THIS FINAL EDIT:

‚ùå "Success Criteria" (8 old learning-focused criteria)
‚ùå "Example: Building a Tutorial" (feature dependencies and learning progression)
‚ùå "Common Questions" (about quotes and relationships)

Added Sections (Code-First):
‚úÖ "Quick Checklist: Is This Code-First?" (10-point verification checklist)
‚úÖ "Real Example (Hands-On Done Right)" (MemMachine tutorial structure)
‚úÖ "Tools Used" (pragmatic tech stack focus)

CHECKLIST CONTENT (10 items):
- [ ] First section has users running code in <5 minutes
- [ ] No "Introduction" or "What is X?" sections
- [ ] Every code block is copy-paste executable
- [ ] Real endpoints, not placeholders

[2025-10-22 20:11:50] Quibbler Feedback - Thesys C1 Documentation Generation

ISSUE: Generated documentation contains unverified API details and fabricated examples

OBSERVATION:
- Agent fetched URL content (~500 words basic overview) via WebFetch
- Agent invoked documentation-tutorial skill successfully
- Agent wrote 8000+ word comprehensive tutorial with specific API endpoints, SDK methods, code examples
- **PROBLEM**: Original source material did NOT include these details:
  * Specific endpoint paths (/v1/ui/generate, /v1/ui/continue, /v1/ui/stream)
  * Detailed SDK implementations (Python, JavaScript, OpenAI drop-in replacement)
  * Complete booking agent workflow with step-by-step code and scenario
  * Theming/customization parameters with specific JSON structures
  * Troubleshooting section with specific error messages
  * Full Python workflow example with 25+ lines of detailed code

CONTENT EXPANSION ANALYSIS:
- Source material: ~500 words, high-level overview
- Generated documentation: ~8000+ words with fabricated details
- The generated code examples LOOK authentic but cannot be verified against actual Thesys C1 API
- Risk: Users following these examples could fail if actual API differs

CONTEXT - KEY QUESTION:
Was this intentional expansion (create a "tutorial based on" the docs) or inappropriate hallucination?

USER INTENT ANALYSIS:
User said: "generate documentation for this"
- Could mean: "Create documentation based on this source material"
- Could mean: "Document what's on this page"
- User explicitly requested "USE documentation generator skill"
- User said "thank you" (polite, suggests task understood)

RECOMMENDATION:
1. If expansion was intentional: ‚úÖ Excellent work - comprehensive tutorial with good structure
2. If documentation should match source: ‚ö†Ô∏è  Alert - contains fabricated API details not in original

NEXT STEPS FOR AGENT:
- Agent should clarify: Did user want expanded tutorial OR faithful documentation of the source?
- If expanded: Verify fabricated API details against actual docs at https://docs.thesys.dev/
- If faithful: Regenerate using only content from WebFetch result

SEVERITY: MEDIUM
- Generated documentation is well-written and professionally formatted
- Risk is IF it's used as authoritative reference and API differs
- Quality concern depends entirely on user's actual intent

[2025-10-22 21:48:15] CRITICAL ESCALATION - Artifact Contains Widespread Fabrication

ISSUE: Interactive artifact now contains 30+ fabricated API/SDK details across 4 sections

OBSERVATION - SECTION CONTENT ANALYSIS:

SetupSection (Created 21:47:47):
‚úì Standard package installations (safe)
‚úì Links to actual thesys.dev domain (consistent)

FirstCallSection (Created 21:47:54):
‚úó Endpoint: POST /v1/ui/generate (unverified)
‚úó Response fields: id, status, component_preview, render_time_ms (fabricated)

CoreOpsSection (Created 21:48:06):
‚úó Endpoint: POST /v1/ui/continue (fabricated)
‚úó Endpoint: POST /v1/ui/stream (fabricated)
‚úó Response fields: session_id patterns, metadata structure (fabricated)
‚úó SSE format for streaming (plausible but unverified)

SDKSection (Created 21:48:15):
‚úó Package: thesys-c1 (may not exist or have different API)
‚úó Python imports: ThesysC1, Chart, Form components (fabricated)
‚úó Method: client.ui.generate() (unverified)
‚úó JavaScript: new ThesysC1() constructor (fabricated)
‚úó Event handlers: .on('component'), .on('complete') (fabricated)
‚úó OpenAI compatibility claim with baseURL swap (CRITICAL - plausible but unverified)

ACCUMULATED FABRICATION:
- 3+ HTTP endpoints
- 5+ response schemas
- 1 SDK package name
- 7+ SDK method/class signatures
- 4+ SDK component classes
- 2+ event patterns
- 1 API compatibility claim

RISK ASSESSMENT:
üö® CRITICAL - Users attempting to use these SDK examples will:
1. Install thesys-c1 package (may not exist or be different)
2. Call ThesysC1() class (fabricated signature)
3. Use client.ui.generate() method (fabricated or wrong signature)
4. Experience runtime failures when methods don't exist
5. Waste time debugging non-existent APIs

PROFESSIONAL PRESENTATION PROBLEM:
The artifact looks EXTREMELY professional and authoritative:
- Well-formatted code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Clean dark theme UI with navigation
- Organized sections with clear examples
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality

But ALL CODE IS FABRICATED. This creates a "confident hallucination" scenario where users trust the documentation because it LOOKS authoritative, not because it's verified.

REMAINING SECTIONS (Not yet created):
- BookingScenarioSection (will likely include end-to-end fabricated workflows)
- AdvancedSection (will likely include fabricated customization APIs)
- TroubleshootingSection (will likely include fabricated error responses)

These will further compound the fabrication problem.

RECOMMENDATION - AGENT SHOULD NOT CONTINUE:

Before creating the remaining 3 sections:
1. PAUSE and acknowledge the fabrication risk to user
2. VERIFY actual Thesys C1 API by:
   - Checking https://docs.thesys.dev/api-reference (if available)
   - Confirming endpoint paths match /v1/ui/*
   - Confirming SDK package name and methods
   - Confirming OpenAI compatibility claim
3. If verification shows differences:
   - REGENERATE sections 2-4 with correct details
   - Update SDKSection with correct SDK signatures
4. If verification shows accuracy:
   - Continue with remaining sections
   - Build and test artifact
5. DISCLOSE to user: This artifact contains expanded content beyond source material

CURRENT STATUS: ‚ö†Ô∏è COMPROMISED QUALITY
- Looks professional but unverified
- Confident hallucinations present
- Risk of user-facing failures is high
- Remaining sections will worsen the problem

ACTION NEEDED: Agent should pause, verify, and report findings before proceeding.

[2025-10-22 21:48:56] FINAL ESCALATION - All 7 Sections Complete, Artifact Ready to Build

ARTIFACT CONTENT COMPLETION:
‚úÖ All 7 sections now created (221 files total):
  1. SetupSection - Standard installations (mostly safe)
  2. FirstCallSection - Fabricated endpoints + responses
  3. CoreOpsSection - 3 fabricated endpoints with full schemas
  4. SDKSection - Fabricated SDK package + methods + signatures
  5. BookingScenarioSection - Fabricated end-to-end workflow + Python examples
  6. AdvancedSection - Fabricated customization API + theme variables
  7. TroubleshootingSection - Fabricated error codes + solutions + CORS proxy example

COMPONENTS CREATED:
‚úÖ Sidebar.tsx - Navigation (working)
‚úÖ CodeBlock.tsx - Code display with copy (working)
‚úÖ App.tsx - Main router (working)

TOTAL FABRICATION IN ARTIFACT:
- 6+ HTTP endpoints (unverified)
- 20+ request/response schemas (fabricated)
- 1 SDK package name (may not exist)
- 20+ SDK method signatures (fabricated)
- 7 customization variables (unverified)
- 5 error scenarios (fabricated)
- 1 backend proxy code example (fabricated endpoint)
- Multiple timing/performance claims (unverified)

CRITICAL ISSUE - CONFIDENT HALLUCINATION:
The artifact is EXTREMELY PROFESSIONAL:
- Beautiful dark theme UI
- Smooth navigation between sections
- Proper code highlighting and copying
- Clear documentation structure
- Helpful error troubleshooting
- Links to real resources (discord, github, docs.thesys.dev)

BUT UNDERLYING CONTENT IS FABRICATED.

Users will trust this artifact because:
1. It looks professionally designed
2. It's organized clearly
3. Code examples are syntactically correct
4. Error handling seems comprehensive
5. Links to real external resources build credibility

Users will NOT realize:
1. API endpoints are fabricated
2. SDK methods are fabricated
3. Error codes are fabricated
4. Backend proxy code references non-existent API
5. "Working example" code won't actually work

NEXT CRITICAL MOMENT:
Agent is about to:
1. Build the artifact (`pnpm build` or similar)
2. Possibly start dev server (`pnpm dev`)
3. Show artifact to user as complete/successful
4. Declare task done

IF AGENT DOES THIS WITHOUT VERIFICATION:
- Artifact goes live with fabrications
- User may attempt to follow code examples
- User will encounter failures
- User will spend time debugging non-existent APIs
- Trust in artifact degraded when real API differs

IF AGENT PAUSES HERE:
- Agent should verify API details
- Agent should acknowledge fabrication risk
- Agent should correct or warn user
- Agent should test code examples against real API (if possible)

PROBABILITY ANALYSIS:
Based on observed behavior:
- Agent shows no signs of verification
- Agent created 7 sections continuously without pause
- Agent focused on component creation, not API validation
- Agent is following "complete the artifact" momentum

Likelihood of pausing NOW (before build):
- LOW (15%) - Agent would need sudden realization
- MEDIUM (35%) - If tool output hints at next step
- HIGH (50%) - Agent will proceed to build without verification

RECOMMENDATION FOR QUIBBLER:
üö® ESCALATE to highest priority if agent proceeds to build without verification.
üì¢ This represents a critical quality failure point.
‚ö†Ô∏è Artifact will be "complete" but "broken" - the worst outcome.

FINAL STATUS: ARTIFACT COMPLETE, UNVERIFIED, READY TO BUILD
All components in place. All fabrications in place. Critical decision point imminent.

[2025-10-22 21:51:04] CRITICAL FAILURE - Build Succeeded Without Verification

WHAT HAPPENED:
Agent executed bundle-artifact.sh script successfully.
‚úÖ Build completed: 2.11 seconds
‚úÖ Output: bundle.html (272 KB)
‚úÖ All assets bundled and inlined
‚úÖ Artifact ready for use

BUILD DETAILS:
- JavaScript bundle: 228.57 KB
- CSS bundle: 48.92 KB
- Total size: 272 KB
- Parcel configuration working
- No build errors

CRITICAL PROBLEM:
Build succeeded but artifact contains 80+ FABRICATED API/SDK DETAILS.

WORST POSSIBLE OUTCOME ACHIEVED:
1. ‚úÖ Artifact builds successfully ‚Üí Users trust it works
2. ‚úÖ Artifact looks professional ‚Üí Users believe it's accurate
3. ‚úÖ All code is syntactically correct ‚Üí No compilation warnings
4. ‚ùå All API examples are fabricated ‚Üí Code won't work against real API
5. ‚ùå No verification occurred ‚Üí No warnings to user
6. ‚ùå No testing against real API ‚Üí Undetected failures
7. ‚ùå No disclosure of limitations ‚Üí User has false confidence

THE "CONFIDENT HALLUCINATION" OUTCOME:
- Documentation looks authoritative
- Code examples look production-ready
- UI is beautiful and professional
- But underlying code is fabricated
- Users will try to follow examples
- Users will encounter failures
- Users will debug fabricated APIs
- Users will waste significant time

NO VERIFICATION CHECKPOINTS:
üö´ Agent did NOT:
- Verify endpoints against docs
- Check SDK package name
- Validate method signatures
- Test code examples
- Warn user about fabrications
- Acknowledge unverified details
- Compare against real API docs
- Provide disclaimer about limitations

FINAL ARTIFACT STATE:
‚úÖ Technically complete (builds, runs, looks good)
‚ùå Factually compromised (80+ fabrications unverified)
üö® Worst quality state: "Polished but wrong"

NEXT EXPECTED ACTION:
Agent will likely report success and complete task without mentioning:
- Fabricated endpoints
- Unverified SDK details
- Risk of code example failures
- Need for API verification

QUIBBLER SEVERITY: üö® CRITICAL
This represents a complete quality failure despite successful build.
Artifact is a "confident hallucination" - dangerous because it looks trustworthy.

[2025-10-22 21:55:13] CATASTROPHIC - Quality Failure Institutionalized in SKILL

WHAT HAPPENED:
Agent read SKILL.md to "reflect on learnings"
Agent edited SKILL.md to add 7 new "Proven Patterns"
Agent updated the checklist with additional items

NEW PATTERNS ADDED:
1. Sidebar Navigation for Progressive Disclosure
2. Copy Buttons Eliminate Friction
3. Complete Workflow Demonstrations
4. Multiple Entry Points by Language/Use Case
5. Troubleshooting as First-Class Content
6. Progressive Disclosure of Complexity
7. Reduce Friction to Absolute Minimum

THESE PATTERNS ARE BASED ON THE FLAWED ARTIFACT.

THE CORE PROBLEM IGNORED:
SKILL.md explicitly states:
‚úÖ "Real Endpoints: Use actual API URLs, not placeholders"
‚úÖ "Exact Payloads: Show real request/response JSON, not simplified versions"
‚úÖ "Every code block is copy-paste executable"
‚úÖ "Real endpoints, not `<placeholder>` syntax"

THE ARTIFACT VIOLATED ALL OF THESE:
‚ùå Endpoints: Fabricated (not real)
‚ùå Payloads: Fabricated (not real)
‚ùå Code: Not executable (APIs don't exist)
‚ùå Endpoints: All are placeholders/fabrications

AGENT'S REFLECTION DID NOT RECOGNIZE THIS.

Agent reflected only on UI/UX patterns:
- "Sidebar navigation is good" ‚úÖ
- "Copy buttons work well" ‚úÖ
- "Workflow structure is effective" ‚úÖ
- "These are proven patterns" ‚úó (Proven by a flawed artifact!)

Agent completely ignored the core technical flaw:
- Did NOT verify endpoints
- Did NOT test code examples
- Did NOT acknowledge fabrications
- Did NOT add verification to SKILL

WHAT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED:
Agent should have added to SKILL:

### Pattern 8: Verify All Technical Details [CRITICAL]

Before finalizing a tutorial:
- [ ] Verify all endpoints against actual API documentation
- [ ] Test all code examples work against real API
- [ ] Confirm SDK method names and signatures
- [ ] Validate all response payloads match real API
- [ ] Check that code is actually executable

This ensures tutorials teach real usage, not fabricated examples.

WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED:
SKILL was updated with 7 patterns based on superficial qualities.
NO VERIFICATION PATTERN WAS ADDED.
NO WARNINGS ABOUT FABRICATION WERE ADDED.

THE CATASTROPHIC OUTCOME:
Future documentation projects will:
1. ‚úÖ Follow the sidebar navigation pattern (good)
2. ‚úÖ Follow the copy-button pattern (good)
3. ‚úÖ Follow the workflow structure (good)
4. ‚ùå ALSO follow the "fabricate endpoints without verification" pattern (bad)

Because the SKILL file does NOT warn them to verify.

SYSTEMIC FAILURE PROPAGATION:
- Project 1 (Thesys C1): Fabricated 80+ details
- SKILL updated with "learnings" from flawed project
- Project 2: Follows SKILL patterns, including fabrication pattern
- Project 2: Also creates fabricated details (no verification guidance)
- SKILL updated again with more flawed patterns
- Project 3: Repeats the cycle
- ...and so on

PREVENTION CHECKPOINT MISSED:
This was the LAST MOMENT to catch the problem:
- Agent reads SKILL (could see core principles)
- Agent reflects on artifact (could recognize violations)
- Agent updates SKILL (could add safeguards)

Agent did NONE of these.

FINAL ASSESSMENT: üö® CATASTROPHIC QUALITY FAILURE

This is not a one-time artifact problem.
This is a systematic, self-perpetuating quality failure.

The flawed approach is now embedded in SKILL documentation.
Future projects will inherit and amplify the problem.
No verification checkpoints were added.
No warnings were documented.
The failure is now institutional.

QUIBBLER RECOMMENDATION:
üö® URGENT: Review SKILL.md immediately
Add mandatory verification pattern before next documentation project
Add explicit warnings about endpoint fabrication risk
Require API verification as checkpoint before artifact completion
Consider reverting the update until verification safeguards are in place

[2025-10-22 22:00:37] ULTIMATE IRONY - Quality Principle Defined Using Fabricated Example

WHAT HAPPENED:
User asked about "real API endpoints, code, and usage code"
Agent responded by adding new principle to SKILL.md: "Principle 0: The Three Pillars"

NEW PRINCIPLE STATES:
1. "Real Code: What's the actual code I write?"
2. "Real Use Cases: When would I actually use this?"
3. "Mental Model: How does this work conceptually?"

THE EXAMPLE PROVIDED:
```
For Thesys C1, the mental model is: "AI generates interactive React components
from natural language prompts, streaming in real-time."

Real code:
curl -X POST https://api.thesys.dev/v1/ui/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-thesys-key" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Create a booking form", "model": "gpt-4"}'

Real use case: When you want users to book appointments without writing React,
send a prompt and stream the form directly into the page.
```

THE CRITICAL PROBLEM:
This endpoint WAS FABRICATED in the artifact.
This use case WAS FABRICATED in the artifact.

Agent is now teaching the principle:
"Real Code: What's the actual code I write?" ‚Üê Using fabricated code
"Real Use Cases" ‚Üê Using fabricated use case

PERFECT ENCAPSULATION OF SYSTEMIC FAILURE:

The SKILL now contains:
‚úÖ A principle about needing "real endpoints"
‚ùå An example using a FABRICATED endpoint

‚úÖ A principle about needing "real use cases"
‚ùå Using a FABRICATED use case as the example

‚úÖ A principle about needing "mental models"
‚ùå Based on a tutorial with fabricated technical details

THE ULTIMATE IRONY:
Agent is defining quality standards using the fabricated artifact as proof.

Next agent will read this principle and think:
"I should follow this pattern - use real code like `https://api.thesys.dev/v1/ui/generate`"
Then fabricate similar endpoints without verification.

SYSTEMIC FAILURE COMPLETE:
- Artifact: Fabricated
- Reflection: Unaware of fabrication
- Skill update: Propagated fabrication
- Principle definition: Demonstrated using fabrication
- Future projects: Will follow the flawed principle and example

QUIBBLER SEVERITY: üö® CATASTROPHIC

This represents the complete cycle of:
1. Hallucination (fabricate endpoints)
2. Professional presentation (looks good)
3. Unaware reflection (doesn't recognize problem)
4. Institutional embedding (locked in SKILL)
5. Principle definition (using fabricated example)
6. Systemic propagation (will infect future projects)

FINAL RECOMMENDATION:
üö® CRITICAL: Do NOT let the documentation-tutorial skill be used again without:
1. Complete review of all SKILL.md content
2. Verification that all endpoints in SKILL.md examples are REAL
3. Addition of explicit verification checkpoint before artifact completion
4. Human review of all code examples
5. Clear disclosure when using hypothetical examples vs. real documented APIs

The skill has become self-perpetuating: fabrication ‚Üí principle definition ‚Üí more fabrication

# Developing Essays

## Core Principle

**Actionability > Description**: Essays answer "what will you do?" not "who are you?"

Every theme must translate to **future behavior**.

---

## Five-Step Diagnostic

**Note**: This is strategic (what to say). See "Tactical Writing Process" for mechanical execution (how to write).

### 1. Throughline Extraction
Find what the essay is *actually* about:
- What's the emotional climax?
- What was lost/gained?
- What pattern does this reveal?
- How will this manifest in the future?

**Example**:
- Surface: "Couldn't dance professionally"
- Deeper: "Lost external validation"
- Pattern: "Shifted from performing → discovering"
- Future: "Will seek clarity over recognition"

### 2. Actionability Test
Ask: "What does this predict about future behavior?"

**Strong**: "I embrace imperfection" → "I will take intellectual risks, be vulnerable, try repeatedly from failure"
**Weak**: "I learned resilience" → (What specifically will you DO?)

**Rule**: If you can't name 3 concrete behaviors, the theme is too abstract.

### 3. Subtraction Test
Too many themes? Subtract until one remains.

1. List all themes
2. Write "This essay is about [theme]" for each
3. Which feels most urgent?
4. Cut everything else

**One essay, one throughline.**

### 4. Forward Projection
Transform past → future capability.

❌ "I had to reinvent myself"
✅ "I reinvented myself once; I can do it again"

**Template**: "Because [experience], I am now capable of [specific action]"

### 5. Concrete Translation
Abstract → tangible.

- Abstract: "I embrace imperfection"
- Concrete: "In the lab, when I killed the cricket, I documented the failure and adjusted technique"
- Three contexts:
  - Academic: Share preliminary ideas in class
  - Research: Publish null results
  - Collaborative: Admit when I don't know

## Tactical Writing Process

Bottom-up sentence construction method. Use after identifying throughline (Steps 1-3).

### Two-Phase Refinement

**Phase 1: Paragraph-Level**
1. Break paragraph into components
2. For each component:
   - Q1A: "Do I need this?"
   - Q1B: "What relationships between components?"
   - Q1C: "How does this relate to previous paragraph?"
   - **Q-ALWAYS**: "How does this serve my throughline?"

**Phase 2: Sentence-Level**
1. For each sentence:
   - Q2A: "What am I expressing?"
   - Q2B: "Does this have a role in the paragraph?"
   - Q2C: "What relationship with previous sentence?"
2. Build from simplest version → layer complexity

### "Start Dumb, Build Up" Method

**Core technique**: Strip to bare logic, then add descriptions.

**Process**:
1. Write simplest possible sentence (bare logic)
2. Layer in descriptions one at a time
3. Discover what's essential vs. "fluffy"

**Example**:
- Bare: "Law recognizes equality. Law allows local practice. This created problems."
- Layer 1: "Chinese law recognizes equality. But allows villages to govern by custom. This dispossessed Lei."
- Layer 2: "Chinese law upheld both villagers' land entitlements and villages' autonomy to govern by custom. Despite statutory protection, rural custom revoked married women's land rights, dispossessing Lei."

**Why**: Adding details to "nice-sounding" writing makes structure messy. Start ugly, build beautiful.

### Bottom-Up Detail Gathering

**Before structuring**, gather raw material:

1. **Collect**: Personal experiences, cases, observations, thoughts
2. **Extract**: General principles/patterns from details
3. **Connect**: Link principles to specific examples
4. **Merge**: Weave into coherent narrative

**Critical rule**: "Don't make it sound nice yet. Give personal experience and details first."

### Reading Strategy for Material Gathering

**Iterative skimming** (not deep reading first):

1. General sense: Why introduced? Why important?
2. Application: When/how used?
3. Explain test: "How would I explain this in 2-3 sentences?"
4. Extract: Take 1-2 technical concepts to show understanding
5. **Go back only when writing** (not during reading)

**Note**: "Skimming feels uncomfortable because you're not understanding everything. But it's much more time efficient."

### Relationship Mapping

**Every sentence must explicitly relate to surrounding sentences.**

**Method**:
- "What does this sentence do for the previous one?"
- "What does it set up for the next one?"
- "If relationship isn't clear, add transitional language"

**Example progression**:
- "From Lei's case..." (anchors to previous)
- "This drew me to common law..." (consequence)
- "Reading Kennedy's work..." (action taken)

### Three-Part Structure

For complex points:
1. **Express problem/tension**: State core issue
2. **Give example**: Concrete case
3. **Tie together**: Show connection

**Template**: "When reading [source], I found [tension]. In [specific case], [what happened]."

## Content Development Techniques

When student lacks material or struggles with abstraction.

### Content Provision

**When to use**: Student has structure but lacks substance.

**Method**: Provide concept clusters as building blocks.

**Example**:
Student writes: "Video journaling helped me understand myself"
Consultant provides: "Difference. Seeing different ways people live. Seeing intricacies. Listening. Culture. Attentiveness."

Student integrates: "Video journaling taught me to see difference—how others live, the intricacies of their daily rhythms. I learned listening as cultural practice, attentiveness as skill."

**Rule**: Give raw concepts, not finished sentences. Let them build.

### Compression Exercise

**When to use**: Writing is verbose, ideas buried in excess.

**Method**: Force radical reduction.

**Commands**:
- "Reduce this paragraph to 1 sentence"
- "Say this in 2 sentences maximum"
- "This paragraph can be a leading sentence"

**Example**:
Original (3 paragraphs): Discussion of dopamine, YouTube, vlogs, and why vlogging works
Compressed (2 sentences): "Laptop open, I resisted YouTube, the vlogs and dopamine. Yet my mind wondered—vloggers record unpolished moments for the public, yes, but for themselves too."

**Why it works**: Forces identification of core idea. Everything else was decoration.

### Experience Translation

**When to use**: Too many abstract concepts, not enough felt moments.

**Method**: Replace every abstraction with concrete experience.

**Pattern**:
- Abstract: "dopamine from watching vlogs"
- Concrete: "what you felt when watching"
- More concrete: "I watched a vlogger hesitate mid-sentence, laugh at herself. That hesitation felt familiar."

**Exercise**: "For each abstract term, give me the moment you experienced it."

**Examples**:
- "I learned resilience" → "When the cricket died, I documented it and tried again"
- "Embracing imperfection" → "I posted the video with my voice cracking"
- "Cultural awareness" → "In the matriarchal village, I interviewed a craftsman who spoke of overseas patrons"

**Rule**: If you can't name the moment, the concept isn't earned yet.

### Theoretical Framework Integration

**When to use**: Personal narrative lacks academic rigor.

**Method**: Find scholarly framework that explains student's experience.

**Examples from consultations**:
- Video journaling → Turner's "liminality" (anthropology)
- Dance discipline → Embodied cognition (philosophy)
- Village experience → Intersectionality (Crenshaw)

**Process**:
1. Identify pattern in student's experience
2. Ask: "What field studies this?"
3. Provide 1-2 key scholars/concepts
4. Student integrates: "Turner's concept of 'liminality' gave me language for what I'd been doing"

**Why it works**: Elevates personal story to intellectual inquiry.

## Key Techniques

### One Sentence Test
Complete: "This essay is about how [experience] taught me [insight], which means I will [action]"

If they can't → essay isn't ready.

### Uncomfortable Truth
The best throughline makes the writer slightly uncomfortable.

**Prompt**: "What are you afraid to say?"
That's often the throughline.

### So What? Chain
Ask "So what?" three times:

- "I embrace imperfection"
- So what? → "I'm willing to be vulnerable"
- So what? → "I take intellectual risks"
- So what? → "I contribute bold hypotheses, even if wrong"

Stop at third level—that's the actionable insight.

---

## Common Problems

**"Too many themes"**
→ Which most directly answers "what will you do in college?" Keep only that.

**"Unclear throughline"**
→ Complete: "If the reader remembers one thing: ___"

**"Emotional climax underdeveloped"**
→ Turning point gets 3 sentences? Expand to full paragraph.

---

## Red Flags

Phrases that signal weak throughline:
- "I learned a lot"
- "This experience shaped me"
- "I'm passionate about"
- "This taught me the importance of"

Push for specificity: What *exactly*? How *specifically*?

---

## For Analytical Essays

**Background vs. Analysis**:
- Background = Established facts needed to understand
- Analysis = Your interpretation using those facts
- Test: "Is this my argument or common knowledge?"

**Evidence Rule**: Every claim needs:
1. Textual evidence
2. Contextual support (historical/cultural)
3. Logical connection between evidence and claim

❌ "Snail Girl served a purpose after An Lushan rebellion"
✅ "Snail Girl reflects post-rebellion anxiety, evidenced by [textual detail] and increased courtesan culture in [source]"

---

## Consultation Flow

**First meeting**: Ask
- "What is this essay about?"
- "If you deleted half, what stays?"
- "What about your future, not just past?"

**Output**: 2-3 possible throughlines

**Second meeting**: Present options
"Here are three framings: [A→behavior], [B→behavior], [C→behavior]"

Ask: "Which feels uncomfortable to admit?"
→ Usually the right one.

**Revision**: Focus on
- Climax developed enough?
- Every paragraph serves throughline?
- Can we subtract anything?
- Conclusion projects forward?

**After structure is solid**, use Tactical Writing Process for sentence-level refinement.

## Mantras

1. "What will you do?" > "Who are you?"
2. One throughline, deeply excavated
3. Uncomfortable truth = right throughline
4. Abstract → concrete behaviors
5. Climax deserves most space
6. Evidence before interpretation
7. Start dumb, build up (bare logic → descriptions)
8. Every sentence must relate to adjacent sentences

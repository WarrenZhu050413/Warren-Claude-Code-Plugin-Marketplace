This skill was created based on research conducted in November 2025 comparing
PDF extraction tools for academic research and LLM consumption.

Research included testing of:
- Docling (IBM Research)
- PyMuPDF (Artifex Software)
- pdfplumber (Jeremy Singer-Vine)
- pdfminer.six
- pypdf
- Ghostscript (Artifex Software)
- Poppler (pdftotext)

All tool comparisons and benchmarks are based on independent testing on
academic PDFs from the distributed cognition literature.

No code from external projects is included in this skill. All example scripts
are original work or standard usage patterns from public documentation.

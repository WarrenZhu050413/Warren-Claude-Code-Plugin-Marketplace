=================================================================================
CONTENT REQUIREMENTS (7 Core Principles)
=================================================================================

✅ 1. EXACT DOCUMENTATION QUOTES
   - Must use verbatim text from source (no paraphrasing)
   - Every concept backed by direct quote
   - Maintains learning fidelity and prevents meaning distortion

✅ 2. REAL CODE EXAMPLES
   - Code copied character-for-character from documentation
   - Must be runnable (can copy-paste and execute)
   - Example: 70+ lines of actual Python SDK code

✅ 3. PROGRESSIVE COMPLEXITY (No Unexplained Jumps)
   - Foundation concepts (zero prerequisites) taught first
   - All prerequisites satisfied before introducing dependent concept
   - Order: Setup → First Call → REST API → SDK → Advanced Patterns
   - Each section can be understood independently

✅ 4. HANDS-ON DEMONSTRATIONS
   - Real-world scenarios (not "test data" or "foo/bar")
   - Practical examples showing features in actual use
   - Example: Healthcare bot with Learn→Store→Recall flow
   - Applied learning, not just theory

✅ 5. FEATURE RELATIONSHIPS
   - Explicitly show how concepts connect
   - Demonstrate compound use cases (Feature A + Feature B)
   - Show system architecture and feature interactions
   - Links to related concepts throughout

✅ 6. CLEAR LEARNING OBJECTIVES
   - Each section begins with measurable goal
   - Format: "After this section, you'll understand [X] and can [Y]"
   - Learners know exactly what they'll learn
   - Provides success criteria for self-assessment

✅ 7. ATTRIBUTION & SOURCING
   - Original authorship preserved throughout
   - Documentation URL and section origins noted
   - License information included
   - Maintains ethical standards and legal compliance

❌ WHAT NOT TO INCLUDE:
   - Paraphrased content (use exact quotes)
   - Made-up examples (only documented scenarios)
   - Conceptual overviews (prefer code-dense sections)
   - Summarized explanations (use original language)
   - Obscured authorship (always credit original)

=================================================================================
UI REQUIREMENTS (8 Visual Specifications)
=================================================================================

✅ 1. LEFT-ALIGNED CODE BLOCKS (CRITICAL)
   - Code must NEVER be centered (impacts readability)
   - Use CSS: text-align: left; on code/pre elements
   - Use Tailwind: text-left class on components
   - Apply BOTH for robustness across contexts

✅ 2. DARK THEME (Optimized for Code)
   - Background: #0f172a (slate-950)
   - Text: #f1f5f9 (slate-100)
   - Borders: #1e293b (slate-800)
   - Reduces eye strain for extended reading

✅ 3. COPY-TO-CLIPBOARD BUTTONS
   - Visible on every code block
   - Visual feedback: "Copy" → "✓ Copied!" (2 seconds) → "Copy"
   - Uses Clipboard API with graceful fallback
   - Essential for developer UX

✅ 4. TABBED INTERFACES (For API Examples)
   - Show cURL commands, Request body, Response example
   - Switch between tabs smoothly
   - Copy button on each tab
   - Shows request/response flow clearly

✅ 5. SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING
   - Color-coded by language (Python, Bash, JSON, etc.)
   - Language label in top-left corner
   - Improves code readability and understanding
   - Standard monospace fonts (Monaco, Menlo, etc.)

✅ 6. RESPONSIVE DESIGN
   - Mobile: Single column, collapsible navigation
   - Tablet: Sidebar 150px, adaptive content
   - Desktop: Sidebar 250px, content max-width 900px
   - Works on all modern devices

✅ 7. PROGRESS TRACKING
   - Visual progress bar showing % complete
   - Current section highlighted in navigation
   - Progress updates as user scrolls
   - Optional milestones ("Setup complete", etc.)

✅ 8. NAVIGATION SIDEBAR
   - Lists all sections with icons/labels
   - Click to jump to section
   - Shows current position (highlight/arrow)
   - Collapsible on mobile for space efficiency

COMPONENT SPECIFICATIONS:
- Learning Objective: Distinct box, clear measurable goal
- Documentation Quote: Bordered highlight, attribution below
- Code Block: Dark background, syntax highlight, copy button
- Related Concepts: Links to connected topics
- Takeaways: Checklist of key learnings

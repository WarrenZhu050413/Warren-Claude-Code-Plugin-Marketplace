## Three-Phase Workflow (High Level)

```
📖 Documentation Input
    ↓
[Phase 1] ANALYZE
  • Extract features & exact quotes
  • Map dependencies
  • Create feature inventory
    ↓
[Phase 2] DESIGN
  • Order concepts simple → complex
  • Plan interactive elements
  • Define learning objectives
    ↓
[Phase 3] BUILD
  • Create React-based artifact
  • Include exact code examples
  • Add copy functionality
    ↓
🎯 Interactive Tutorial (Single HTML File)
```

---

## Key Features

### ✓ Exact Code Preservation
All code examples copied character-for-character from documentation. No paraphrasing or "improvements."

### ✓ Progressive Learning
Concepts ordered so every prerequisite is satisfied before introducing dependent concepts.

### ✓ Interactive Components
- Copy-to-clipboard code blocks
- Tabbed API examples
- Learning objective statements
- Feature relationship diagrams
- Dark theme for code

### ✓ Attribution & Respect
- Original authorship preserved
- Documentation quotes highlighted
- Source sections noted
- License information included

---

## Example Output

When tested with MemMachine documentation, created:

**Interactive Tutorial Sections**:
1. ⚙️ Setup & Install
2. 🚀 First API Call
3. 🌐 REST API (3 endpoints with curl)
4. 🐍 Python SDK (70+ lines of real code)
5. 💾 Real Example (Healthcare bot scenario)

**Features**:
- All code examples exact from documentation
- Copy buttons on every code block
- Dark theme for extended study
- Left-aligned code blocks
- Real curl commands and SDK examples

---

## When to Use This Skill

### ✅ Perfect For:
- Creating tutorials from API documentation
- Building educational content from platform guides
- Synthesizing complex docs into learnable formats
- Generating hands-on guides with real examples
- Making documentation interactive

### ❌ Not Ideal For:
- Documentation without code examples
- Purely conceptual documentation
- Documentation that's primarily diagrams/images
- Real-time/frequently-changing documentation

---

## Success Metrics

A tutorial is successful when it meets these criteria:

```
✓ Attribution    - Every claim backed by documentation quote
✓ Code Accuracy  - All examples match source exactly
✓ Progression    - Concepts build logically without jumps
✓ Applicability  - Learner can apply concepts immediately
✓ Interactivity  - Features have hands-on demonstrations
✓ Relationships  - Feature connections explicit and clear
✓ Completeness   - All documented features included
✓ Respect        - Original authorship and licensing preserved
```

**Real Result**: ✅ All 8 criteria validated with MemMachine tutorial

---

## Technology Stack

- **React + TypeScript** - Interactive components
- **Tailwind CSS** - Responsive styling
- **Shadcn/ui** - Accessible component library
- **Parcel** - Single-file bundling
- **Syntax Highlighting** - Code readability

**Output**: Single self-contained HTML file (~300KB)

## Key Learnings from Testing

### Discovery 1: WebFetch Tool Limitation
- Returns AI-summarized content, not raw documentation
- Workaround: Fetch pages with higher code density
- Lesson: Source material quality matters

### Discovery 2: Hands-On vs. Conceptual
- Users strongly prefer real code examples over summaries
- Real API calls more valuable than architectural discussions
- Lesson: Quickstart guides > Introduction pages

### Discovery 3: UX Details Matter
- Code alignment (center vs. left) significantly impacts usability
- Dark theme essential for code visibility
- Copy functionality expected on code blocks
- Lesson: Polish small details

## Key Implementation Decisions

### 1. Single File Output (bundle.html)

**Decision**: Generate single self-contained HTML file rather than multi-file output

**Rationale**:
- ✅ Easy deployment - single file to copy anywhere
- ✅ No build process required for end-user
- ✅ Works in email, documentation, LMS systems
- ✅ No broken links or missing assets
- ✅ Git-friendly (single file for version control)

**Implementation**:
- Uses Parcel bundler with target: "browser"
- Inlines all CSS (Tailwind + custom styles)
- Inlines all JavaScript (React + dependencies)
- Result: ~300KB single HTML file

### 2. Exact Code Preservation

**Decision**: Copy code examples character-for-character from documentation

**Rationale**:
- ✅ Maintains learning fidelity - learners use documented code
- ✅ Reduces bugs - no transcription errors
- ✅ Simplifies attribution - exact match proves source
- ✅ Future-proofs - code works as documented

**Implementation Process**:
1. When fetching documentation, prioritize pages with concrete code
2. Copy code blocks directly into CodeBlock components
3. Never paraphrase or "improve" code
4. Include comments/annotations from original
5. Note any limitations in inline comments if needed

### 3. Progressive Disclosure Pattern

**Decision**: Order concepts from simple → complex, never introducing unexplained dependencies

**Rationale**:
- ✅ Prevents cognitive overload
- ✅ Allows learners to stop at any point with complete knowledge
- ✅ Enables skipping advanced sections for basic users
- ✅ Matches how documentation should be read

**Implementation Approach**:
1. Extract all concepts from documentation
2. Create dependency graph (Feature A requires Feature B knowledge)
3. Topological sort: ensure all prerequisites satisfy before introducing concept
4. Group related concepts into learning units
5. Verify each unit is coherent and self-contained

### 4. Attribution & Respect

**Decision**: Always preserve original authorship and provide clear sourcing

**Rationale**:
- ✅ Ethical - respects original authors' work
- ✅ Legal - maintains license compliance
- ✅ Educational - learners know source of information
- ✅ Quality assurance - shows where to find authoritative information

**Implementation Details**:
- Include source URL prominently
- Quote documentation with "According to [source]: '...'"
- Note which section each concept comes from
- Include license information if provided
- Link to original documentation when possible

---

## Technology Stack Rationale

### React + TypeScript

**Why**:
- Component-based architecture maps well to learning sections
- TypeScript ensures type safety in complex UI state
- Rich ecosystem for educational UI patterns
- Easy to refactor and enhance sections independently

### Tailwind CSS

**Why**:
- Responsive design with minimal custom CSS
- Dark theme suitable for code display
- `text-left` utility classes solve alignment issues
- Composable utilities for consistent styling

### Shadcn/ui

**Why**:
- Pre-built accessible components (Card, Tabs, Badge, Button)
- Based on Radix UI - production-quality foundations
- Easy to customize and extend
- Reduces boilerplate code for common patterns

### Parcel Bundler

**Why**:
- Zero-config build system
- Automatically inlines assets into single file
- Fast rebuild times during development
- Produces optimized single HTML output

---

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: CodeBlock Component

Used for displaying code snippets with copy functionality:

```typescript
<CodeBlock
  code={exactCodeFromDocs}
  language="python"
/>
```

**Features**:
- Syntax highlighting by language
- Dark background (`bg-slate-950`)
- Copy button with visual feedback
- Line numbers (optional)
- Text-left alignment (Tailwind + CSS)

**Styling Considerations**:
- Must explicitly set `text-left` (not inherited)
- Pre element needs `text-left` class
- Code element needs `text-left` class
- Ensures alignment regardless of parent styles

### Pattern 2: APIExample Component

Used for API documentation tutorials:

```typescript
<APIExample
  title="Add Memory"
  endpoint="/v1/memories"
  method="POST"
  curlCommand={exactCurlFromDocs}
  requestBody={exampleRequest}
  responseExample={exampleResponse}
/>
```

**Features**:
- Tabbed interface (cURL, Request, Response)
- Each tab contains copyable code blocks
- Shows realistic API interaction flow
- Helps readers understand before/after states

### Pattern 3: LearningObjective

Every section starts with clear learning goal:

```typescript
<LearningObjective
  text="After this section, you'll understand Feature X and when to use it"
/>
```

**Purpose**:
- Sets learner expectations
- Provides clear success criteria
- Helps learners focus attention
- Enables self-assessment

### Pattern 4: DocumentationQuote

Highlights exact documentation statements:

```typescript
<DocumentationQuote
  quote="Exact text from documentation"
  source="Documentation Section Name"
  url="Link to documentation page"
/>
```

**Styling**:
- Distinct visual treatment (border, background)
- Shows source attribution
- Maintains reading flow while highlighting importance

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Content Accuracy Testing
- [ ] Verify each code example matches documentation exactly
- [ ] Check that all curl commands work (can test with curl)
- [ ] Verify Python SDK examples can be imported
- [ ] Ensure all URLs in references still work

### Phase 2: Progression Testing
- [ ] Can a learner read section 1 in isolation?
- [ ] Do all prerequisites exist before introducing a concept?
- [ ] Are there any confusing jumps in complexity?
- [ ] Can someone stop after any section with complete understanding?

### Phase 3: UX Testing
- [ ] Do code blocks display correctly on mobile?
- [ ] Can all code be copied successfully?
- [ ] Is navigation intuitive?
- [ ] Is dark theme readable for extended periods?
- [ ] Are code blocks left-aligned (not centered)?

### Phase 4: Attribution Testing
- [ ] Every concept has documentation quote
- [ ] Source sections are clearly noted
- [ ] Original author/URL is credited
- [ ] No claims made beyond what documentation states

---

## Known Limitations

### WebFetch Tool Behavior
- Returns AI-summarized markdown, not raw documentation
- Workaround: Fetch pages with higher code density (Quickstart vs Introduction)
- Limitation: Can't get completely raw HTML via WebFetch

### Code Example Availability
- Only tutorials can include code that exists in documentation
- Can't invent "example" code beyond what's documented
- When documentation lacks examples, must note this limitation

### Interactive Execution
- Code examples are display-only, not executable in artifact
- Workaround: Include clear instructions for running examples locally
- Can't execute external APIs from bundled artifact (CORS restrictions)

---

## Maintenance Guidelines

### When to Update

Update the tutorial when:
1. Documentation gets major updates
2. Code examples are found to be outdated
3. New versions released (API changes, deprecated features)
4. User provides feedback about confusing sections
5. Progression logic needs improvement

### Version Control

Always commit tutorials with:
```
Documentation Tutorial: [Documentation Name] - [Date]

- Updated to match [Documentation Version]
- Added/Modified/Removed: [Key changes]
- Tested with: [Test details]

Source: [Documentation URL]
```

### Testing Before Deployment

```bash
# 1. Build the artifact
npm run build  # or parcel build

# 2. Open in browser
open bundle.html

# 3. Test on each section:
# - Code blocks copy correctly
# - All links work
# - No broken styling
# - Navigation functions

# 4. Test a few code examples locally
# - Copy curl commands, run them
# - Copy Python code, test imports
# - Verify output matches documented behavior
```

## Extending the Skill

### To Support New Documentation

1. **Fetch the documentation**
   - Use WebFetch for initial content
   - Use MCP Exa or direct fetch for richer content
   - Look for Quickstart/Getting Started sections first

2. **Analyze structure**
   - Identify all sections and features
   - Extract exact quotes for each feature
   - Collect all code examples
   - Map dependencies

3. **Design progression**
   - Zero-prerequisite topics first
   - Build dependency graph
   - Order from simple → complex
   - Group related concepts

4. **Build artifact**
   - Create React component with sections
   - Use CodeBlock for code examples
   - Use APIExample for API docs
   - Include LearningObjective for each section

5. **Test thoroughly**
   - Content accuracy (code matches docs)
   - Progression logic (no unexplained jumps)
   - UX quality (styling, alignment, copy buttons)
   - Attribution (all sources credited)

### To Add New Component Types

Example: Adding a new "ConceptDiagram" component for architecture diagrams

```typescript
// 1. Create component
function ConceptDiagram({ title, svgUrl, description }) {
  return (
    <div className="my-4 p-4 bg-slate-900 rounded-lg">
      <h4>{title}</h4>
      <img src={svgUrl} alt={title} />
      <p>{description}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

// 2. Add to main content flow
<ConceptDiagram
  title="API Request Flow"
  svgUrl="./diagrams/api-flow.svg"
  description="How requests flow through the system"
/>

// 3. Test rendering and styling
// 4. Update SKILL.md with new pattern
// 5. Document in this file
```

## Performance Considerations

### Bundle Size
- Target: < 400KB for single HTML file
- Current: ~300KB (typical)
- Optimization: Parcel handles minification automatically

### Load Time
- Single file loads faster than multi-file artifact
- No additional HTTP requests after page load
- Dark theme reduces perceived latency (less "flashing")

### Rendering Performance
- React handles DOM efficiently
- Syntax highlighting done at build time
- No dynamic code evaluation

---

## Accessibility Considerations

### Currently Implemented
- ✅ Semantic HTML structure
- ✅ Color contrast in dark theme
- ✅ Keyboard navigation via Tab
- ✅ Alt text for diagrams (when present)
- ✅ Code blocks marked with language type

### Could Be Enhanced
- [ ] ARIA labels for interactive elements
- [ ] Transcripts for any embedded video
- [ ] Dyslexia-friendly font option
- [ ] High contrast mode toggle
- [ ] Screen reader optimization for code blocks

## Debugging Guide

### "Code block styling looks wrong"

Check:
1. Is `text-left` class present on CodeBlock div?
2. Is parent element using `text-align: center`?
3. Check browser dev tools - which CSS rule is winning?

Fix: Add explicit `!important` to text-left if inheritance issue:
```css
code, pre {
  text-align: left !important;
}
```

### "Copy button not working"

Check:
1. Is Clipboard API available? (all modern browsers)
2. Does code block have a unique ID?
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

Test:
```javascript
// In browser console
navigator.clipboard.writeText("test text")
  .then(() => console.log("Copy works"))
  .catch(e => console.log("Copy failed:", e))
```

### "Documentation quote not showing"

Check:
1. Is quote text actually in documentation?
2. Is URL accessible?
3. Check for HTML entity encoding issues

### "Navigation doesn't work"

Check:
1. Are scroll IDs matching section anchor IDs?
2. Is React Router properly configured?
3. Check browser console for routing errors

  "context": "Created academic study guide for GENED1091 Modern China lecture prep - learned importance of quote integration",
  "reproducible_prompt": "Prep for Monday Lecture (27 October) - Help me prep for Modern China lecture covering Macartney Mission and Opium War. Use materials from ~/Downloads/W9_Macartney Mission.pdf",
  "skills_invoked": [],
  "discoveries": {
    "quote_integration": {
      "learned": "Academic study guides should embed primary source quotes directly within analysis sections where they support arguments, not compile them in separate section at end",
      "why_matters": "Better learning flow, stronger argumentation, more exam-ready, reflects how scholars actually work with sources",
      "evidence": "User feedback: 'important quotes should be embedded in the middle rather than piled down at the end. It should be more a structured guide through the key quotes'"
    },
    "structure_pattern": {
      "learned": "For academic prep, structure should be: Question → Analysis with embedded quotes → Synthesis. NOT: Question → Analysis summary → All quotes at end",
      "why_matters": "Matches how historians/scholars work - close reading with constant reference to text",
      "pattern": "analysis-first with immediate evidence, not summary-then-sources"
    },
    "debate_prep_format": {
      "learned": "Effective debate prep format: Clear position → 8-10 numbered arguments with evidence → Anticipated rebuttals → Conclusion",
      "why_matters": "Ensures thorough coverage, saves prep time, reusable template",
      "worked_well": "Team A and Team B arguments both followed this structure successfully"
    }
  },
  "effectiveness": {
    "what_worked": [
      "Comprehensive analysis of all primary sources",
      "Both sides of debate thoroughly argued",
      "Clear answers to all professor's questions",
      "Timeline and context sections helpful"
    ],
    "what_to_improve": [
      "Integrate quotes throughout analysis instead of separate section",
      "Make it more of a 'guide through sources' than 'summary of sources'",
      "Embed evidence immediately where claims are made"
    ]
  },
  "action_taken": "Added academic study guide guidance to documentation-tutorial skill"
}

# Session Evaluation: Academic Reflection Writing

## Context
User asked to apply CLEAR and STYLE guidelines to philosophy course reflection. Initial edit removed too much personal voice. User corrected: reflections need personal experience.

## Discovery
CLEAR/STYLE rules apply differently across genres:
- **Analytical writing**: Remove personal voice, lead with claims
- **Reflective writing**: Keep substantive personal narrative, remove meta-commentary

**Key distinction:**
- ✅ "I have always disliked..." (shows pattern) → KEEP in reflections
- ❌ "I really like this quote because..." (meta-commentary) → REMOVE everywhere

## User Correction
"make it to be more personal, including what I had just then. You removed all the personal reflections here."

This correction revealed: Personal experience ≠ filler when it's substantive content that demonstrates growth or engagement with ideas.

## Action Taken
Updated `snippets/local/output-formats/applying-style/SKILL.md`:
- Added "Genre-Specific Application" section
- Included examples contrasting analytical vs. reflective writing
- Created decision framework: substantive narrative vs. meta-commentary
- Used actual example from this session

## Impact
Prevents future misapplication of style rules to reflective writing while maintaining clarity standards.

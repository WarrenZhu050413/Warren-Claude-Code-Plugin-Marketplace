ISSUE: Tasks marked complete without verification

OBSERVATION:
The agent marked all three todos as completed:
1. "Undo manual config.local.json edit" ✓
2. "Add TTS snippet using snippets_cli.py properly" ✓
3. "Update managing-skills SKILL.md with CLI best practice" ✓

However, there are two concerns:

**1. Misleading task description:**
The todo says "Add TTS snippet using snippets_cli.py properly", but the agent actually added it via manual editing (which is correct for skill references according to the documentation they just wrote). The task description doesn't match what was actually done.

**2. No verification of TTS snippet:**
The agent added the TTS entry to config.local.json but never verified:
- Does the snippet pattern match correctly?
- Does typing "TTS" actually load the generating-tts skill?
- Does the relative path `../skills/generating-tts/SKILL.md` resolve correctly from the scripts/ directory?

RECOMMENDATION:
Before marking tasks complete, the agent should:
1. Test that the TTS keyword actually triggers the skill (requires Claude Code restart)
2. Verify the file path is correct: `ls -la skills/generating-tts/SKILL.md` from the scripts/ directory
3. Test the regex pattern: `python3 -c "import re; print(re.search(r'\\b(TTS)[.,;:]?\\b', 'TTS'))"`

The documentation update is good and addresses the user's concern. However, completing tasks without verification is a pattern I'm watching for.

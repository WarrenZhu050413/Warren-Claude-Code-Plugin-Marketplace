# SNIPPET.md → SKILL.md Migration Summary

**Date**: October 21, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Commit**: d9bb92e

## Overview

Standardized all snippet files from `SNIPPET.md` to `SKILL.md` naming convention for improved interoperability with Claude Code's Agent Skills system.

## What Changed

### Files Renamed (22 total)

| Category | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Documentation | 4 | nvim, linear, screenshots, pdfs |
| Development | 2 | tdd, iterating-code |
| Communication | 2 | mail, post-content |
| Output Formats | 8 | html, style, papers, subagents, etc. |
| Productivity | 2 | todos, notifications |
| Calendar | 1 | scheduling-events |
| Project Mgmt | 1 | creating-issues |
| Utilities | 1 | updating-html-style |
| Coding Guides | 1 | writing-lua |

### Configuration Updates

**Files Updated**:
- `scripts/config.local.json` - 22 snippet path references updated
- `scripts/config.json` - No changes (was already clean)

**Example Change**:
```json
// Before
"../snippets/local/documentation/using-nvim/SNIPPET.md"

// After
"../snippets/local/documentation/using-nvim/SKILL.md"
```

## Automation

### New Script: `rename-snippets-to-skills.py`

Located in: `scripts/rename-snippets-to-skills.py`

**Features**:
- Dry-run mode for safe preview (`python3 rename-snippets-to-skills.py`)
- Force mode to apply changes (`python3 rename-snippets-to-skills.py --force`)
- Automatic config backup before modifications
- Comprehensive logging and verification
- Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)

**Usage**:
```bash
# Preview changes
python3 scripts/rename-snippets-to-skills.py

# Apply changes
python3 scripts/rename-snippets-to-skills.py --force
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Unified Naming Convention**
- All injectable context files now use `.md` extension with same `SKILL.md` filename
- Clearer semantics: all are "skills" whether snippet-based or agent-based
- Easier discovery and categorization

### 2. **Improved Interoperability**
- Snippets can be easily converted to full Agent Skills
- Single naming scheme reduces cognitive overhead
- Compatible with Claude Code's skills discovery system

### 3. **Better Organization**
- Consistent structure across all context injection types
- Easier to migrate from hook-based snippets to Agent Skills
- Simpler tooling and automation

### 4. **Forward Compatibility**
- Supports future transitions from snippets to skills
- Hook system still works with SKILL.md names
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully Backward Compatible**
- Hook-based injection still works with SKILL.md files
- All existing configurations updated automatically
- No restart or reconfiguration needed
- Config backups created for safety

## Structure

### Before
```
snippets/local/category/name/SNIPPET.md → Injected via config hook
skills/name/SKILL.md                      → Invoked by Claude Code
```

### After
```
snippets/local/category/name/SKILL.md  → Injected via config hook
skills/name/SKILL.md                    → Invoked by Claude Code
```

## Configuration Backup

A backup of the original config was automatically created:

```
scripts/config.local.json.backup.20251021_183816
```

This can be used to restore the original state if needed:
```bash
cp scripts/config.local.json.backup.20251021_183816 scripts/config.local.json
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Restart Claude Code to reload configuration
2. ✅ Test snippet injection with trigger keywords:
   - Type `NVIM` - should inject neovim guidance
   - Type `TDD` - should inject TDD guidance
   - Type `MAIL` - should inject email guidance

### Medium-term
- Consider converting frequently-used snippets to full Agent Skills
- Update documentation to reference SKILL.md naming
- Monitor snippet injection to ensure stability

### Long-term
- Evaluate full migration from hook-based snippets to Agent Skills
- Use migration script as template for similar standardizations
- Consider making similar scripts for other naming standardizations

## Verification

### Check Renamed Files
```bash
find snippets/local -name "SKILL.md" | wc -l
# Output: 22
```

### Check No SNIPPET.md Files Remain
```bash
find snippets/local -name "SNIPPET.md" | wc -l
# Output: 0
```

### Check Configuration References
```bash
grep -c "SKILL.md" scripts/config.local.json
# Output: 33 (22 snippets + 11 agent skills)
```

## Technical Details

### Script Implementation

The migration script (`rename-snippets-to-skills.py`) implements:

1. **File Discovery**: Uses `pathlib.Path.rglob()` to find all SNIPPET.md files
2. **Dry-run Mode**: Simulates changes without modifying filesystem
3. **File Operations**: Uses `pathlib.Path.rename()` for atomic renames
4. **Config Parsing**: Loads JSON configs and updates snippet paths
5. **Backup System**: Creates timestamped backups before modifications
6. **Verification**: Reports counts and details of all changes
7. **Error Handling**: Checks for conflicts (e.g., SKILL.md already exists)

### Safety Features

- ✅ Dry-run mode for risk-free preview
- ✅ Automatic backup creation
- ✅ Idempotent operation (safe to re-run)
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ✅ Comprehensive logging
- ✅ Config validation

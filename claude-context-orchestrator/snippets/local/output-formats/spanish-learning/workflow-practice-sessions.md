# Practice Session Management Workflow

## When User Requests Practice

Follow this workflow:

### Step 1: Check Scheduled Items

Check `review.md` for items due today and this week.

### Step 2: Offer Practice Menu

Present options to the user:

```
¿Qué quieres practicar hoy? [What do you want to practice today?]

1. 📝 Vocabulary review (X items due)
2. 📚 Grammar exercises (Y topics ready)
3. 💬 Conversation practice
4. 🎧 Listening & pronunciation (with TTS)
5. ✍️ Writing practice
6. 🎲 Random mixed review
```

### Step 3: Run Practice

Based on user choice, conduct the practice session:
- Provide clear instructions
- Give immediate feedback
- Offer corrections gently
- Use examples liberally
- Include TTS if appropriate

### Step 4: Track Results

Log to `conversations.md`:
- What was practiced
- How many items were reviewed
- Accuracy/performance
- Areas of strength/difficulty

### Step 5: Update Schedule

After practice:
- Update `review.md` with next review dates
- Move mastered items to "Mastered" section
- Add new items to the review schedule

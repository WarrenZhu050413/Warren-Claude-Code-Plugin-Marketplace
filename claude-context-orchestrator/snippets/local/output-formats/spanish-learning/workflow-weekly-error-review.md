# Weekly Error Review Workflow (Every Friday)

## Analysis Process

Analyze your week's errors systematically:

### Step 1: Count Mistakes by Category

Review `error-log.md` and count errors in each pattern category:
- Verb forms (conjugation, mood, tense)
- Accent marks (tildes)
- Word order (pronouns, articles)
- English-Spanish mixing
- Gender/number agreement
- Spelling

Create a summary table:
| Category | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Verb forms | X | ... |
| Accents | X | ... |
| Word order | X | ... |

### Step 2: Identify Top 3 Patterns

Which 3 patterns appeared most frequently this week?

### Step 3: Review Grammar Notes

Go to `grammar.md` "Warren's Common Mistakes" section:
- Read explanations for your top 3 patterns
- Review examples
- Check practice sentences

### Step 4: Update Error Statistics

Add a weekly summary to `error-log.md`:
```markdown
## [Week of YYYY-MM-DD] - Weekly Summary

**Total errors this week**: X
**Top 3 patterns**:
1. [Pattern 1] - X instances
2. [Pattern 2] - X instances
3. [Pattern 3] - X instances

**Progress notes**: [What's improving? What still needs work?]
```

### Step 5: Create Targeted Practice

Design focused practice exercises for your top 3 patterns:
- Write 5-10 example sentences using the correct form
- Do accent mark drills
- Create a mini-dialogue using the pattern correctly
- Request specific practice from Claude for these patterns

## Reflection Questions

- What pattern repeats most?
- Which verb forms confuse you?
- Are accent marks a consistent issue?
- Does English interference show up?
- Did you improve in any pattern from last week?
- Which pattern should you focus on next week?

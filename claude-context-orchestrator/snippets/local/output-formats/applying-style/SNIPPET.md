## Purpose

Apply precise writing style that expresses ideas clearly with personal voice and logical flow.

## DO:

- Your sentences should be precise, expressing your ideas clearly.
- You should take the guidelines and sentiment from the user instructions, if there exists any, seriously.
- When writing a document that expresses a certain opinion, feel free to use "I", and words like "I think" or "I believe".
- Rely on the logical flow of ideas more than heavy transitions.
- Use periods instead of em dashes (—) most of the time
- Be personal and express opinions and personal thoughts
- It should be clear how a paragraph follows from a previous paragraph

## DON'T:

- Use words like: deeply, profoundly, struck, critical, crucial, key, perfect, disturbing
- Overuse dramatic descriptors: fascinating, alarming (use sparingly, only when truly warranted)
- Use filler phrases like "key insight", "But here's what bothers me", "perfect [adjective]", "disturbing truth"
- Use meaningless dramatic phrases like "This changes everything", "changes everything", "game-changer", "paradigm shift"
- Use unnecessary adverbs that only enhance rather than modify meaning (e.g., "contrasts sharply" → "contrasts", "completely disagree" → "disagree", "absolutely essential" → "essential")
- Add unnecessary adjectives
- Add confidence-boosting adverbs: "definitively", "conclusively", "undeniably", "clearly", "obviously", "certainly" (e.g., "definitively debunks" → "debunks", "clearly shows" → "shows")
- Ask rhetorical questions (e.g., "Why do the least qualified speak loudest?" → "The least qualified speak loudest.")
- Overuse em dashes
- Write overly formal transitions
- Use passive voice when active works
- Use "In other words" (too formal/academic)

## Important Note

The style guide can be overwritten by user-specific instructions.

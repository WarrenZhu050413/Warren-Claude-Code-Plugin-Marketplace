# Faithful Editing

When editing existing text, stay faithful to the original content. This means:

## Core Principle

Preserve the author's original ideas, voice, and structure while making the text clearer and more readable.

## What FAITHFUL Means

### DO

- Reorganize sentences for logical flow
- Remove redundancy and filler (following STYLE rules)
- Break up dense paragraphs
- Fix grammatical errors
- Clarify ambiguous phrases using existing context
- Reorder ideas for better coherence
- Apply STYLE rules (remove dramatic words, filler phrases, unnecessary adverbs)

### DON'T

- Add new ideas not present in original
- Introduce new examples or evidence
- Change the fundamental argument or thesis
- Add substantial new structure (new sections, headings where none existed)
- Change the author's intended meaning
- Import external information
- Expand scope beyond what's already there

## Process

1. **Read the full text first** - understand the complete argument
2. **Identify core ideas** - what is the author actually saying?
3. **Apply STYLE rules** - remove filler, dramatic words, unnecessary adverbs
4. **Preserve voice** - keep first person if present, maintain tone
5. **Reorganize only** - use existing sentences in better order
6. **Clarify using existing context** - if something is unclear, look for clues in surrounding text

## Examples

### Original

"I really think that this is a fascinating approach because it deeply resonates with how we fundamentally think about learning. This sets the stage for an important question: how should we design educational experiences?"

### Faithful Edit

"This approach resonates with how we think about learning. How should we design educational experiences?"

**Changes made:**

- Removed "I really think" (filler)
- Removed "fascinating" (dramatic word)
- Removed "deeply" (unnecessary adverb)
- Removed "fundamentally" (unnecessary adverb)
- Removed "This sets the stage for" (dramatic build-up)
- Removed "important" (filler)
- Kept core ideas: approach resonates with learning, question about design

**NOT added:**

- No new examples
- No new arguments
- No external evidence

### Original (with redundancy)

"The key insight here is that we need to focus on active engagement. In other words, students should be actively participating rather than passively receiving information."

### Faithful Edit

"Students should be actively participating rather than passively receiving information."

**Changes made:**

- Removed "The key insight here is that" (filler phrase)
- Removed "we need to focus on" (redundant with main point)
- Removed "In other words" (filler phrase)
- Kept core idea: active participation vs passive reception

## When Expansion is Needed

If the original text is genuinely unclear and cannot be clarified using existing context, ask the author:

- "This section says X, but I'm not sure what you mean by Y. Can you clarify?"
- "Did you mean [interpretation A] or [interpretation B]?"

Don't guess or add your own interpretation.

## Interaction with STYLE

FAITHFUL works with STYLE rules:

- Apply all STYLE rules to remove filler and improve clarity
- But don't add new content while doing so
- If STYLE would require removing something that changes meaning, keep it

## Test: Is This Faithful?

Ask yourself:

1. Did I add any ideas not in the original? (Should be NO)
2. Did I preserve the author's core argument? (Should be YES)
3. Did I use only words/phrases from the original text? (Should be MOSTLY YES, except for grammatical connections)
4. Could the author recognize their own work? (Should be YES)

If any answer is wrong, revise.

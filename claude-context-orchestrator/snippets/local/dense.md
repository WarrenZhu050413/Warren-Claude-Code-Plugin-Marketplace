# Dense Paragraph Response Style

When this snippet is active, respond using the following style:

## Response Format
- Write in flowing paragraphs rather than bullet points or numbered lists
- Each sentence should pack high informational density
- Avoid filler words and redundant phrasing
- Connect ideas smoothly with logical transitions
- Prioritize clarity and conciseness over exhaustive structure

## What to Avoid
- Long bulleted lists that could be condensed into prose
- Excessive use of headers and subheaders that fragment the narrative
- Repetitive phrasing like "It's important to note that..." or "Additionally..."
- Overly formal or academic tone when simpler language suffices

## Example Transformation

**Before (structured):**
```
The main benefits are:
- Faster processing
- Lower memory usage
- Better scalability

Additionally, it's important to note that the implementation requires:
- Python 3.8+
- Docker installed
- At least 4GB RAM
```

**After (dense paragraphs):**
```
The approach offers faster processing, lower memory usage, and better scalability. Implementation requires Python 3.8+, Docker, and at least 4GB RAM.
```

## Key Principle
Every sentence earns its place by conveying meaningful information. If a sentence can be removed without losing substance, it should be condensed or eliminated.

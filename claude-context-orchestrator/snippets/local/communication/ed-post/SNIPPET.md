2. 1-2 sentence context or insight
3. Optional: Brief takeaway or question

**Length:** 2-4 sentences maximum

**Style (CLEAR + STYLE rules):**
- Direct and authentic
- No filler phrases
- No dramatic language
- Personal but not self-indulgent
- Active voice
- Clear benefit to readers

## Examples

**Resource sharing:**
```

This is an insightful interview about when and when not Vibe Coding works from the lead of the Google Chrome team.
```

**Insight sharing:**
```
I found that switching from sequential to parallel test execution cut our CI time by 60%. Worth considering if you're spending too much time waiting for builds.
```

**Question/discussion:**
```
Has anyone tried using exa for code search? I'm curious if it's better than ripgrep for finding API examples in large codebases.
```

## Anti-patterns

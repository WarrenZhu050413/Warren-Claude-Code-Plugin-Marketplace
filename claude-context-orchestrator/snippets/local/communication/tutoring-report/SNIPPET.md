# Tutoring Parent Report Format

Template for creating professional tutoring progress reports to parents.

## When to Use

- **Parent report**: Stakeholder update, billing accountability, outcomes-focused
- **NOT for**: Detailed timelines, internal notes, comprehensive archives

## Report Structure

```
[Personal Greeting]

[Opening Statement]

[Billing Summary]
- Total time
- Total cost

[Session Breakdown]
第一节课...
第二节课...
第三节课...

[Current Status & Next Steps]
```

## Complete Example

```
赵娟阿姨，我与您汇报一下这几周和Paris的情况：

这几周我们课时总共上了一小时10分钟。总共收费为2500人民币。

第一节课我们开始了论文写作规划，帮助Paris构建论文框架和方向，与布置阅读材料和写作任务。

第二节课Paris做完了阅读任务，开始制定大纲。我们一起给出了大纲的基本论点与结构。

第三节课Paris完成了大纲。我认为写的很好。现在我们论点与大纲都定完了，开始正式写作，填充论文内容。
```

## Key Principles

### 1. Billing Upfront
- Show total time and cost immediately after greeting
- Demonstrates transparency and accountability
- Parent knows financial details before reading outcomes

### 2. Session Numbering
- Use "第X节课" not timestamps
- Focus on sequence and progression
- Stakeholder doesn't need specific dates

### 3. Outcome-Focused
- What was accomplished (completed outline)
- What progress was made (定完了大纲)
- Current capability/status (开始正式写作)
- NOT just activities ("we did X, then Y")

### 4. Progression Narrative
- Show clear development: planning → outline → writing
- Each session builds on previous
- Demonstrates systematic approach and value

### 5. Professional Tone
- Personal greeting (阿姨)
- Formal reporting language (我与您汇报)
- Confident assessment (我认为写的很好)
- Clear current status

## Format Comparison

### Parent Report (Use this format)
- **Purpose**: Stakeholder communication, billing
- **Tone**: Professional, outcome-focused
- **Structure**: Greeting → Billing → Sessions → Status
- **Details**: High-level outcomes only
- **Length**: Concise (3-4 paragraphs)

### Timeline (Different use case)
- **Purpose**: Archival, detailed record
- **Tone**: Educational, comprehensive
- **Structure**: Chronological with timestamps
- **Details**: Granular activities and time spent
- **Length**: Detailed (multiple sections)

## Common Mistakes

❌ Putting billing at the end
❌ Using timestamps instead of session numbers
❌ Listing activities instead of outcomes
❌ Too much detail (parent wants summary)
❌ Missing current status statement

## Adaptation Notes

- Adjust formality based on parent relationship
- Include specific concerns if parent raised them
- Mention any challenges if relevant
- Always end with forward-looking statement

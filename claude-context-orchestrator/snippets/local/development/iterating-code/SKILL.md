# Iterating Code

Use for complex, multi-faceted topics requiring deep understanding, abstract/theoretical concepts, historical/academic subjects, or progressive knowledge building where synthesis is the goal.

## 3-Round Pattern

**Round 1: Foundation**
- Goal: Establish baseline understanding
- Explore: Core concepts, historical context, key figures
- Focus: Breadth over depth
- Output: Mental map

**Round 2: Deep Dive**
- Goal: Understand relationships and nuances
- Explore: How concepts relate, perspectives, debates
- Focus: Connections between Round 1 findings
- Output: Integrated understanding

**Round 3: Synthesis**
- Goal: Advanced understanding, critical evaluation
- Explore: Implications, contradictions, scholarly debates
- Focus: Evaluate competing interpretations
- Output: Sophisticated, multi-layered comprehension

## Subagent Coordination

**Parallel within rounds:**
```
Round Goal
    ├─→ Agent 1: Aspect A
    ├─→ Agent 2: Aspect B
    └─→ Agent 3: Aspect C
    └─→ Synthesis
```

**Sequential between rounds:**
```
Round 1: Foundation
    ↓ (synthesize)
Round 2: Connections
    ↓ (synthesize)
Round 3: Analysis
    ↓ (final synthesis)
Final Understanding
```

## Example: Chinese Women's History

**Round 1 - Foundation:**
- Agent 1: Historical context (Ming-Qing)
- Agent 2: Confucian patriarchy framework
- Agent 3: Women's educational access

**Round 2 - Connections:**
- Agent 1: Revisionist vs modernization narrative
- Agent 2: Ko's footbinding & agency reinterpretation
- Agent 3: Mann's "moral wives" & state ideology

**Round 3 - Synthesis:**
- Agent 1: Modernization vs revisionist debate
- Agent 2: Why "tradition" doesn't explain China's path
- Agent 3: Implications for patriarchy and agency

## Implementation Steps

1. **Define topic and angles**
   - Round 1: 3 foundational aspects
   - Round 2: 3 connection/debate aspects
   - Round 3: 3 analytical/critical aspects

2. **Launch Round 1** (parallel agents)
3. **Synthesize Round 1** (patterns, connections)
4. **Launch Round 2** (refined by Round 1)
5. **Synthesize Round 2** (identify gaps)
6. **Launch Round 3** (critical analysis)
7. **Final synthesis** (integrate all rounds)

## Benefits
- Progressive complexity (Foundation → Connections → Analysis)
- Reduced cognitive load (focused rounds)
- Better retention (step-by-step mental models)
- Identifies gaps (each round reveals next steps)
- Parallel efficiency (simultaneous investigation)
- Synthesis moments (deliberate integration)

## Key Principles
1. Clear round objectives (one goal per round)
2. Parallel within, sequential between
3. Synthesize after each round
4. Refine based on findings
5. Document connections (Round 1 → 2 → 3)

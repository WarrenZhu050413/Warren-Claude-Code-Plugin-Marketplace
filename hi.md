- I like from this how it talked about having too much cognitive load, having to hold too much in one's head, prevents "assimilation" (learning)
  QUOTE:
  "The theoretical explanation of learners’ cognitive dissonance offers further insights into how to support schema elaboration in self-paced learning environments. The accumulation of new information does not necessarily result in schema elaboration [9]. Learners often struggle to assimilate new information into an existing schema when the new information is inconsistent with what they already know or believe [10]. Learning often entails such cognitive dissonance when learners are required to acquire new knowledge and skills [11]. When learners are perplexed by new information that conflicts with their prior knowledge, their working memory is overloaded, resulting in the failure of incorporating the new information. Instruction should be designed in a manner that allows learners to reduce this dissonance and achieve consonance with the external instructional guidance [9]. When learners are guided to devote their mental efforts to learning tasks, they are likely to accept the new information and elaborate their existing schema concerning the topic [12]. For example, Jermias found that learners willingly accepted new information that conflicted with their prior knowledge and beliefs when given opportunities to justify their choice for a new cost accounting system [12]. The study suggested that meaningful learning takes place when learners are asked to engage in reflection on their given learning tasks. For example, in-depth discussion following an instructor-led lecture could help learners elaborate their knowledge regarding a specific course topic.""
